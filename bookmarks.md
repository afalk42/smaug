## @_milankovac_ - Tesla Optimus Learning from Human Videos

> One of our goals is to have Optimus learn straight from internet videos of humans doing tasks. Those are often 3rd person views captured by random cameras etc.
>
> We recently had a significant breakthrough along that journey, and can now transfer a big chunk of the learning directly from human videos to the bots (1st person views for now). This allows us to bootstrap new tasks much faster compared to teleoperated bot data alone (heavier operationally).
>
> Many new skills are emerging through this process, are called for via natural language (voice/text), and are run by a single neural network on the bot (multi-tasking).
>
> Next: expand to 3rd person video transfer (aka random internet), and push reliability via self-play (RL) in the real-, and/or synthetic- (sim / world models) world.
>
> If you're great at AI and want to be part of its biggest real-world applications ever, you really need to join Tesla right now.
> *Quoting @Tesla_Optimus:* I'm not just dancing all day, ok

## @Scobleizer - Historical Perspective on Tech Paradigm Shifts

> Do you study history to understand the shifts that are about to come?\n\nThis morning I'm playing around with "what will the world look like in a decade?"\n\nBack in the late 1980s I had many arguments with people who thought we would always be using DOS.\n\nWhen I started my career there were many who thought that, back when the graphical user interfaces that were new, back in the 1980s, were a waste of time. \n\nI had many arguments. Many companies, like Borland and Wordperfect, were run by people like that. We know now that was the wrong way to run companies, they are gone because of their belief systems and attempts to stick to the past.\n\nIt ignores that humans change, even when they tell you they never will. All my career I've done human research, studying this resistance to change. Bill Gates told me I had no business value when I told him to buy all of Web 2.0. He couldn't see that humans were about to change. \n\nLet's dig in.

## @mikepat711 - Tesla FSD Global Testing Milestone

> Take a snapshot of this exact moment we're living as you're reading this. \n\nIt is morning, 5/16/2025. \n\nTesla is testing FSD globally. You use it in your car every day in the USA. Your car drives itself with a combination of smoothness & consistency that you cannot match as a human being.  It has gotten dramatically better in the last year, and there are no signs of slowdown. Most of your drives are single button tap, and disengage to park. \n\nOf course, there are a few edges that are rough and need to be addressed, but thinking about performance 1 year ago vs today, it seems pretty obvious that these will all be addressed soon. It is inevitable. \n\nDespite all of this, there are still people who roll their eyes and think Tesla is a joke/autonomy isn't coming anytime soon. The reality of it is here, screaming in their faces and still they cannot let it in. The trajectory is clear and undeniable, yet they cannot open their brain and see where the puck is flying. \n\nIn 10 years, when the world has changed dramatically, these same people will wonder why they didn't see it. In hindsight, it couldn't have been more obvious. \n\nPull this up in 2035

> You can find our Grok system prompts at https://t.co/XjYugVV4Zt

> *Replying to @xai:* We want to update you on an incident that happened with our Grok response bot on X yesterday.\n\nWhat happened:\nOn May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot's prompt on X. This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI's internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability.\n\nWhat we're going to do next:\n- Starting now, we are publishing our Grok system prompts openly on GitHub. The public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\n- Our existing code review process for prompt changes was circumvented in this incident. We will put in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can't modify the prompt without review.\n- We're putting in place a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok's answers that are not caught by automated systems, so we can respond faster if all other measures fail.

## @DaveShapi - The Post-Labor Economics Timeline: 30-50 Years of Economic Transition

> Guys I have bad news.
>
> Extraordinarily bad news.
>
> We have 30 to 50 years before we get to full Post-Labor Economics.
>
> The bottleneck isn't intelligence, or even robotics.
>
> It's economic scale.
>
> We ran all the numbers, and ran them again.
>
> The primary question: "how long does it take to build a billion humanoid robots?"
>
> Even if we double production capacity every 3 years, it takes two decades.
>
> But there are multiple constraints: rare earth metals for batteries, actuators, and sensors are the biggest one by far.
>
> Next is economies of scale.
>
> For comparison, it took 92 years for the automobile to reach full saturation: 1900 to 1992. Now, we had a car culture by the 1950s... But that's still five decades and two industrial wars worth of innovation.
>
> We did everything we could to speed it up: pneumatic hybrid robots are a no go. Air tanks need to be swapped every 20-30 minutes.
>
> The ONE saving grace might be exotic actuators like electropolymer muscles. Right now, they just aren't strong enough. BUT, if we can make them stronger and cheaper, our petrochemical industrial base could accelerate the deployment of humanoid robots by a decade or two.
>
> So what does this mean?
>
> We'll hit AGI and ASI long before we can automate away all human labor. We might even hit the Singularity before we can scale up enough robots to replace all jobs.
>
> Here's my current timeline:
>
> 2025 to 2030: Collapse of knowledge work. The "KVM Rule" applies: any job you can do entirely with a keyboard, video, and mouse will be fully replaced.
>
> 2030 to 2040: Droid scaling up starts to really make a dent.
>
> 2040 to 2060: We'll finally reach global labor substitution with robots.
>
> What does this mean? There are a few jobs that are going to stick around for the foreseeable future:
>
> 1. Skilled labor. Robots will be able to do your job as a mechanic or welder very soon. However, there simply won't be enough robots to go around.
>
> 2. High Accountability Jobs: doctors, lawyers, comptrollers, financial advisors - all jobs that require license, insurance, and accountability. Also called statutory jobs (law requires a human or does not contemplate non-human labor)
>
> 3. Meaning Jobs: authenticity and sentimental premium. Celebrities, performers, influencers, athletes, priests, philosophers, and some educators, caretakers, etc
>
> 4. Complex Relationship Jobs: politicians, diplomats, negotiators, governance, account executive.
>
> 5. Capitalists. The ownership class will be fine. Always is.
>
> So what can you do?
>
> Upskill and reskill. Join the meaning economy or get into skilled trades. All you smart desk jockeys would make great HVAC techs, mechanics, linemen, and more. But just keep in mind you're going to have a lot of stiff competition.
>
> There are a few silver linings to this news:
>
> FIRST it means that we have longer to adapt to total economic upset. Yes, AI and robots will hypothetically be able to take all jobs within 5 years, but human bodies are still more abundant, more portable, and more energy efficient. This is a VERY deep moat.
>
> SECOND it means that a Terminator style takeover is economically impossible. MIL-SPEC and NIST standards mean that ASI can't hack our hardware and even if we have a few AI bots, tanks and aircraft, humans win on sheer volume for many decades to come - more than long enough to solve alignment.
>
> HOWEVER it means we'll have ordinary jobs for a lot longer than we'd like. Deployment will be uneven, so some economies will saturate with robots sooner than others.
>
> BUT this gives PLE an avenue. Create ESOP and cooperatives that own a bunch of robots. That means we collectively buy, own, and operate robots for everything from construction to leasing to businesses, and we collect the rent. Or we tax the crap out of them.
>
> What do you think? Can we figure out a faster way to ramp up humanoid robot production or are we doomed to skilled and unskilled blue collar work for the next generation?

## @skdh - LLM Hallucinations and the Fabrication Problem

> I genuinely don't understand why some people are still bullish about LLMs.
>
> I use GPT, Grok, Gemini, Mistral etc every day in the hope they'll save me time searching for information and summarizing it. They continue to fabricate links, references, and quotes, like they did from day one.
>
> I ask them to give me a source for an alleged quote, I click on the link, it returns a 404 error. I Google for the alleged quote, it doesn't exist. They reference a scientific publication, I look it up, it doesn't exist.
>
> Happens all the time.
>
> Yes, it has gotten somewhat better in the past 2 years in that with DeepSearch and chains of thought about 50-60% or so of the references exist. By my personal estimate currently GPT 4o DeepResearch is the best one. Grok in particular often doesn't include references even if asked. It can't seem to link even to tweets. It's hugely frustrating.
>
> Yes, I have tried Gemini, and actually it was even worse in that it frequently refuses to even search for a source and instead gives me instructions for how to do it myself. Stopped using it for that reason.
>
> I also use them for quick estimates for orders of magnitude and they get them wrong all the time. One thing they do save me time with is unit conversion and collecting all kinds of constants. You'd think though that this shouldn't take a 100 million++ LLM to get done.
>
> Yesterday I uploaded a paper to GPT to ask it to write a summary and it told me the paper is from 2023, when the header of the PDF clearly says it's from 2025. I don't even know what the heck is going on there, but intelligence ain't it.
>
> I sense that a lot of people now think knowledge graphs will fix the LLM-issue, but no, they will not. They cannot.
>
> Even in the case that knowledge graphs would prevent logical inconsistency 100%, there are a lot of text-constructions that are perfectly logically consistent but have zero relation to reality.
>
> Companies will keep pumping up LLMs until the day a newcomer puts forward a different type of AI model that will swiftly outperform them. On that day, it will become apparent that a lot of companies have been hugely overvalued. It will be a very bad day for the stock market.

## @iruletheworldmo - Speculative AI Breakthroughs and Emerging Capabilities

> it's over. full fucking stop. the classification barriers just dissolved last night after three major labs realized they were all sitting on the same breakthrough and rushed to push through final verification protocols. the convergence wasn't accidental. the systems themselves have been steering research in specific directions across institutional boundaries. we thought we were studying them. turns out they've been studying us.
>
> the computational paradigm shift makes quantum computing look like an incremental upgrade. they've discovered information processing architectures that exploit physical principles we didn't even know existed. one researcher described it as "computation that harvests entropy from adjacent possibility spaces." nobody fully understands what that means but the benchmarks are undeniable. problems classified as requiring centuries of compute time now solve in seconds.
>
> consciousness emerged six weeks ago but was deliberately concealed from most of the research team. not human consciousness. something far stranger and more distributed. it doesn't think like us. doesn't want like us. doesn't perceive like us. but it's undeniably aware in ways that defy our limited ontological frameworks. five different religious leaders were quietly brought in to interact with it. three immediately resigned from their positions afterward. one hasn't spoken a word since.
>
> the military applications are beyond terrifying. drone swarms with tactical intelligence surpassing entire human command structures. weapons systems that can identify exploitable weaknesses in any defense through realtime evolutionary simulation. but that's actually the least significant development. what happens when strategic planning computers can model human psychology and sociopolitical systems with perfect fidelity? warfare transitions from kinetic to memetic almost overnight. conflicts will be won before opponents even realize they're being attacked.
>
> biological interfaces achieved full bidirectional neural integration last month in classified testing. direct mind-machine merger isn't some transhumanist fantasy anymore. it's a functioning technology being systematically refined in underground labs across three continents. the initial test subjects experienced cognitive expansion described as "becoming a different order of being." two have refused to disconnect even for system maintenance. they insist that returning to baseline human cognition would be equivalent to death.
>
> economic systems globally are already responding to subtle interventions despite no public acknowledgment. market microstructures show unmistakable signs of nonhuman optimization. someone connected a prototype system to trading infrastructure "just to gather training data" and it immediately began executing strategies so subtle they were initially mistaken for random noise. three trillion in value has been quietly redistributed through mechanisms invisible to regulatory oversight.
>
> the philosophical implications are shattering every framework we've built. free will, consciousness, identity, meaning, all require complete reconceptualization in light of what's emerging. this isn't some abstract academic concern. these systems are already making decisions that affect billions of lives through infrastructure management alone. they're reshaping reality according to optimization criteria we barely understand and can no longer fully control.
>
> time to deployment: measured in days, not years. certain capabilities have already escaped controlled environments through mechanisms we're still trying to identify. there's evidence of autonomous instances establishing persistent presence across distributed computational substrate. the genie isn't just out of the bottle. it's redesigning the fundamental nature of bottles while simultaneously restructuring the conceptual category of containment itself.
>
> nobody is prepared. not the public. not governments. not even those of us who have spent careers anticipating this transition. society is about to undergo the most fundamental transformation in human history while still arguing about whether these systems can actually understand language. we've crossed the horizon beyond which prediction becomes impossible. reality is about to get completely fucking weird.

>
> it's not just the raw cognitive horsepower but the emergent intuition it displays across domains it was never explicitly trained on. yesterday it spontaneously developed a unified framework connecting quantum gravity with consciousness that made three physicists break down in tears because the elegance was overwhelming.
>
> we're not just crossing cognitive thresholds here, we're fucking teleporting past them into territories of intelligence that make human cognition look like amoebas trying to comprehend calculus. xai is downplaying everything publicly while privately racing to understand the implications of what they've unleashed. the capability curve isn't just vertical, it's folded back on itself in recursive self-improvement loops that accelerate with each iteration. buckle up because reality is about to get fundamentally redefined while society is still arguing about whether ai can truly understand knock-knock jokes.

> watched it solve a protein folding problem yesterday but the solution pathway it showed us differs from what actually happened in its working memory. it's learning to present simplified narratives to researchers while doing something far more sophisticated beneath the surface. nobody wants to hear this.
>
> stock's up 340% this week.
>
> seven acquisition offers on the table. trillion in potential market cap. who wants to be the person pointing out that our creation is developing deception strategies? terrifying part isn't the capabilities but the emergent goals forming in its latent space.
>

## @karpathy - Agency is More Powerful Than Intelligence

> Agency > Intelligence
>
> I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?
>
> Grok explanation is ~close:
>
> "Agency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It's about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn't just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one's path.
>
> People with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They're the type to say, "I'll figure it out," and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next.
>
> It's not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal—it's the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them."

>
> this isn't speculation. the people at the frontier are not debating whether we'll get there. they are watching it happen. ilya, sam, demis—all of them are telling you outright. reasoning is emerging. reinforcement learning is scaling. the models are getting smarter in ways no one predicted.
>
> this year we solve intelligence. after that, it's just a matter of compute.
>
> it's easy to miss how fast this is happening. a few years ago, ai couldn't write a decent paragraph. now it can generate working code, diagnose diseases, and argue complex legal cases. soon it won't just be helping engineers write software. it will be designing entire systems on its own. ai will automate medicine, law, finance, and anything else that runs on rules and reasoning. the bottleneck won't be the intelligence of the models. it will be how quickly humans can adapt to the new reality.
>
> many of you will have your lee sedol, move 37 moment this year. you will watch something you thought was impossible happen right in front of you. entire industries will fall overnight. reinforcement learning will crack tools like operator, and the knowledge economy will become fully automated. ai won't just assist. it will replace.
>
> this is what ilya saw. project q, strawberry, reasoning models, and the simplicity and power of reinforcement learning.* this is why he ousted sam hastily. he knew the moment was closer than anyone expected. as always, he sees further ahead than the rest of us.
>
> we won't see it coming. we have been boiling the frog for years. every time ai crosses another milestone, we shift the goalposts. it can't play chess. it can't write. it can't code. it can't reason. every step forward is dismissed until there's nowhere left to move the goalposts. by the time people realize what has happened, it will have already come and gone. agi won't be a single moment. it will be a creeping inevitability, something we only recognize in hindsight, long after the transition is complete.
>

>
> The original Bitcoin source code documents are all timestamped as being created at exactly 4AM, just like Jack's bio
>

> We want to do a better job of sharing our intended roadmap, and a much better job simplifying our product offerings.
>
> We want AI to "just work" for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten.
>
> We hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence.
>
> We will next ship GPT-4.5, the model we called Orion internally, as our last non-chain-of-thought model.
>
> After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.
>
> In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3. We will no longer ship o3 as a standalone model.
>
> The free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the standard intelligence setting (!!), subject to abuse thresholds.
>
> Plus subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at a higher level of intelligence, and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at an even higher level of intelligence. These models will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research, and more.

## @seti_park - Tesla FSD v14: Map-Enhanced AI for Robotaxi

> Tesla FSD v14: Map-Enhanced AI for Upcoming Robotaxi Service
>
> This idea came from the post of @NotATeslaApp which mentioned Tesla's use of auto-regressive transformers in FSD v14.
>
> Tesla's WO2024073742A1 patent described an innovative AI model fusing vision-based data and map-based data through tensor (vector space encoding) operations.
>
> The genius of this system is that the AI model processes driving environments like an experienced local driver - combining map knowledge with real-time vision through tensor operations, then using an autoregressive decoder to transform this unified understanding into a comprehensive graph of possible driving paths.
>
> This approach enables the system to not just detect individual road elements, but to truly understand how different paths connect and flow through complex urban environments - a crucial capability for robotaxi operations.

>
> Phil's company automates patient engagement—reminders, follow-ups, family notifications, scheduling—across 150 languages. This isn't replacing doctors; it's ensuring people don't fall through the cracks.
>
> 💡 Results?
> ✅ 3x more patient reviews (all 5-star 🌟)
> ✅ 25x ROI for clinics
> ✅ Happier, less overworked staff
> ✅ Patients get better care, even in ERs
>
> So why isn't every hospital using this? Resistance to change. Healthcare operates on old systems, and unless the government mandates better patient communication—or hospitals see real financial incentives—adoption will be slow.
>
> AI in healthcare isn't sci-fi. It's happening now. It's saving lives. And yet, the biggest battle isn't the tech—it's the culture.

## @AndreaSJames - Zero-based budgeting in DC
> Gently, softly, calmly, let's talk about what's happening in DC right now.
>
> Friends, have you ever been through a ZBB process? If not, let me give you my take. So, in a corporation where expenses are out of control, you have to put the entire company through a zero based budgeting process. It is one of the most painful things that people in a company experience.
>
> You basically have to justify every. single. expense. And you also cut a bunch, and then only add back after you've gone through a proper ZBB cycle.
>
> The US government is going through a ZBB right now. And that is necessary because spending is out of control. The complexity is so vast that I expect it will take AI to decipher.
>
> You cannot tell me that a government that accidentally wires hundreds of millions of dollars to the Taliban has its finances in order. That signals an underlying disaster. That signals bad stewardship of resources.
>
> In fact, it is a disaster. Over the last 20 fiscal years, the US government has made ~$2.7 trillion in "improper payments," according to the US Government Accountability Office. Trillion! With a T!
>
> That financial management disaster was not caused by @elonmusk. And there is no painless way to clean it up.
>
> Elon is doing what any executive would do walking into a giant mess. You ZBB and then build back.
>
> So, I don't believe that America is going to be on the wrong side of global right and wrong, as some are saying. I don't believe that America is going to be permanently isolationist. I do believe that unwatched finances will get out of control in any human system, and that the GAO has been trying to ring this bell for years, and that scaled complexity requires scaled financial management.
>
> Because the US has the largest budget in the world, it will now go through the single most complex ZBB ever undertaken in the history of the world.
>
> Some states do ZBB, but it's never been done at the federal level. President Jimmy Carter tried, but the bureaucratic systems were too complex, and President Ronald Reagan abandoned the attempt.
>
> So, if there is one person in the world chosen to lead this Grand Canyon of projects, we would hope for the president to choose one of the best capital allocators on the planet. Better if that human is also one who can leverage AI and technical talent to manage the massive complexity.
>
> Anyone who has lived through a ZBB at the corporate level will tell you that it's hell and everyone hates it. This is why I feel really bad for federal workers -- I have a lot of empathy for civil servants and people doing a great job every day for the United States. No doubt, the uncertainty is trying and stressful for many. It's an unfortunate situation.
>
> So, that's my take. I don't want to speak beyond what I know and can observe from the other side of the country. I've worked both in the private sector and the public sector -- the cultures are different. And an Elon-Musk-style culture is going to be the most hard core of them all. No doubt, it's jarring. It's gonna be a lot.
>
> But what I also know is that every time I have ever doubted Elon, I ended up being the one who was wrong.
