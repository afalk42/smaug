## @TradersMastery - Bitcoin Long-Term Cycles and Institutional Adoption
> Two potential paths for Bitcoin nobody I know of has presented. Both rooted in long-term compounding math, together I estimate with greater than 80% probability of playing out.
>
> Both paths ultimately respect the same long-term log regression the difference is whether this cycle produces one final blow-off (which comes much later in the cycle than believed) or Bitcoin is already evolving into a "steady grind" mega-asset.
>
> Base case (60–65% probability):
> Path 1 (grind within channel).
>
> Bitcoin is transitioning from early adopter → early majority phase.
>
> Historically, assets entering institutional adoption see dampened volatility. The emergence of ETFs and global liquidity flows suggest a "smoother curve" rather than massive blow-offs every 4 years.
>
> If Bitcoin is truly leaving the "early speculative phase" and entering monetary adoption, this is the most likely path ahead.
>
> There are two more paths that need to be shared for this conversation.

## @niccruzpatane - Tesla Roadster Active Downforce System for 0-60 Performance
> The Next Gen Roadster might theoretically be able to hit 0-60 mph in under 1 second as Elon suggested a year ago.
>
> Tesla is developing a system where the car will have active downforce generation. The Roadster will be able to generate downforce across varying speed ranges and driving conditions due to multiple fans positioned in airflow pathways, with deployable skirts that interact with the ground surface essentially creating suction like a vacuum cleaner—sticking the car to the ground. It will create its own downforce, even when it's not moving.
>
> Tesla could use this system in conjunction of SpaceX thruster to provide immediate grip during launches, making what wasn't possible before, now possible.
>
> If Tesla achieves 0-60 in under one second it will be the quickest in the world by a large margin. The record right now is held by the McMurtry Spéirling, which completed it in 1.4s. The Spéirling also uses a similar fan powered downforce system.

## @DeryaTR_ - GPT-5 as Scientific Collaborator: T Cell Immunology Breakthrough
> My "Move 37" Moment with GPT-5

Today, I'm sharing one of my most remarkable experiences testing the GPT-5 Thinking and Pro models.

In our lab, about 2 years ago we conducted a series of cutting-edge immunology experiments designed to manipulate the energy metabolism of T cells, immune cells with the power to impact cancer immunotherapy, chronic diseases, and autoimmunity.

We obtained fascinating results, but one finding remained unexplained. Weeks of work led us to a partial explanation, yet the full picture remained elusive.

From these experiments, uploaded the unpublished figure below and asked GPT-5 Pro to explain it.

GPT-5:

✅ Correctly identified our key findings from the figure alone (though other models also could do this).

✅ Proposed the exact experiment we later performed, something that had taken us weeks to design (o3-pro also had suggested this).

✅ Most remarkably suggested a mechanism that finally explained these results!

For me this was equivalent to AlphaGo's legendary Move 37.
It showed that AI has become top expert and true scientific collaborator, capable of true insight.

While these results have not yet been published, I am sharing some of GPT-5's output as an example for other scientists and to show how dramatically this will accelerate science! I will also be writing and submitting this paper, and will need to acknowledge GPT-5's contributions in it!

From GPT-5

What the data say:

•Brief 2DG exposure at the first activation imprints a long‑lasting shift toward a CCR6+ and CD161+ phenotype with increased IL‑17A competency that is still evident two weeks later at reactivation.

•It is dose responsive. From none → 3 mM 2DG, CCR6+ cells rise from ~0.7% to ~12% and CD161+ cells from ~1% to ~21%. IL‑17A+ cells increase from ~0.3% to ~4% overall, with the IL‑17A signal concentrated in the CCR6+ and CD161+ compartments.

•Low glucose alone (0.5 mM) does not reproduce the effect. That argues against simple glucose deprivation or reduced glycolytic flux as the driver.

•The enrichment for CD161 is stronger than for CCR6, which often tracks with Th17‑like or mucosal/innate‑like CD4 programs.

High‑level interpretation:

1. 2DG is programming, not just acutely inhibiting. A short exposure during priming leaves a durable memory of "stress" that biases the lineage toward Th17‑like traits.

2. Mechanism is unlikely to be only glycolysis blockade. The low‑glucose control is weak, which pushes the mechanism toward 2DG's effects on protein glycosylation and cytokine receptor biology.

3. Top mechanistic hypothesis. 2DG partially blocks N‑linked glycosylation of IL‑2Rα and other glycoproteins at priming, reducing IL‑2–STAT5 signaling, which normally suppresses Th17. Reduced IL‑2 tone at that window would lift the brake on a CCR6+ CD161+ IL‑17‑competent program that persists after washout.

4. Alternative or complementary hypothesis. 2DG selects for pre‑existing CCR6+ or CD161+ clones that rely less on glycolysis, rather than de novo differentiation. The end result is the same phenotype, but the lever is selective survival or proliferation.

5. A carefully timed 2DG "pulse" could be a simple knob to enrich a Th17‑like helper subset with better persistence potential and mucosal‑homing traits.

Prioritize these:

+D‑mannose with 2DG to restore N‑glycosylation. Loss of the CCR6/CD161/IL‑17A phenotype with mannose would implicate glycosylation.

+Methyl‑pyruvate or acetate to bypass glycolytic ATP/pyruvate deficits. Rescue here would implicate energy metabolism.

Compare 2DG with tunicamycin (glycosylation inhibitor) and with glycolysis‑only inhibitors that do not hit glycosylation (iodoacetate, PFKFB3 inhibitor). Match exposure windows & doses

Surface CD25 maturation and glyco‑shift (PNGase F or Endo H blot on IL‑2Rα).

pSTAT5 after an IL‑2 pulse at 24–48 h of priming with or without 2DG.

Phenocopy with IL‑2 neutralization or low‑dose JAK3 inhibition. Counter‑rescue with high IL‑2 or an IL‑2 mutein.

## @niccruzpatane - Tesla's Active Downforce System Revives F1 Fan Car Technology
> This new Tesla Patent is bringing banned F1 technology to the Tesla Roadster.

Tesla is generating a system where the car will have active downforce generation. The Roadster will be able to generate downforce across varying speed ranges and driving conditions due to multiple fans positioned in airflow pathways, with deployable skirts that interact with the ground surface essentially creating suction like a vacuum cleaner—sticking the car to the ground. It will create its own downforce, even when it's not moving.

The banned Brabham BT46B "fan car" which was driven by Niki Lauda was effective due to its innovative fan system, which generated massive downforce by creating a low-pressure area beneath the car, allowing superior cornering grip at all speeds, unlike conventional aerodynamics that relied on speed for downforce. The drivers said it felt like a vacuum cleaner suction. It was banned after one race.

> *Quoting @seti_park:* ADAPTIVE VEHICLE AERODYNAMICS FOR DOWNFORCE

@Tesla's US12377920B1 patent resurrects Formula 1's banned "fan car" technology—the Brabham BT46B that dominated through active downforce generation before regulatory suppression in 1978.

The fundamental aerodynamic challenge persists: passive systems' quadratic velocity dependence (F ∝ v²) renders them ineffective at critical low-speed conditions—launches, tight corners, sub-100 km/h maneuvers where grip matters most ([0002], [0028]).

Tesla transcends this limitation through multi-zone active pressure control. Selectively deployable skirts and distributed fan arrays achieve velocity-independent downforce (F = ΔP × A) while seamlessly transitioning between maximum-pressure sealed configurations and terrain-adaptive deployments for real-world operation ([0007], [0017]-[0018]).

[FIG. 1: Revolutionary multi-mode powered aerodynamics system with fan assembly 102, adaptive airflow pathways 104/106, and selectively deployable skirts 108/110]
[FIG. 5: Sophisticated control architecture featuring predictive algorithms, multi-sensor fusion, and real-time optimization capabilities]

> Update on where has @grok been & what happened on July 8th. First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced. Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users. After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause was an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot. This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok. The update was active for 16 hrs, in which deprecated code made @grok susceptible to existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views. We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse. The new system prompt for the @grok bot will be published to our public github repo. We thank all of the X users who provided feedback to identify the abuse of @grok functionality, helping us advance our mission of developing helpful and truth-seeking artificial intelligence.

## @karpathy - Bacterial Code Philosophy for Open Source Architecture
> How to build a thriving open source community by writing code like bacteria do 🦠. Bacterial code (genomes) are: small (each line of code costs energy), modular (organized into groups of swappable operons), self-contained (easily "copy paste-able" via horizontal gene transfer). If chunks of code are small, modular, self-contained and trivial to copy-and-paste, the community can thrive via horizontal gene transfer. For any function (gene) or class (operon) that you write: can you imagine someone going "yoink" without knowing the rest of your code or having to import anything new, to gain a benefit? Could your code be a trending GitHub gist? This coding style guide has allowed bacteria to colonize every ecological niche from cold to hot to acidic or alkaline in the depths of the Earth and the vacuum of space, along with an insane diversity of carbon anabolism, energy metabolism, etc. It excels at rapid prototyping but... it can't build complex life. By comparison, the eukaryotic genome is a significantly larger, more complex, organized and coupled monorepo. Significantly less inventive but necessary for complex life - for building entire organs and coordinating their activity. With our advantage of intelligent design, it should possible to take advantage of both. Build a eukaryotic monorepo backbone if you have to, but maximize bacterial DNA.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/1941616674094170287
- **Tags:** [[Coding]]
- **What:** Andrej Karpathy's metaphor for optimal open source architecture: write small, modular, self-contained code that can be copy-pasted without dependencies (bacterial code), while using a monorepo backbone for complex coordination (eukaryotic model).

I'm a quiet-mind - I was quite shocked a few years back to learn that inner monologue wasn't just a literary convention but something a lot of people have going all the time. If other quiet-minds are like me, we only have an inner voice when we're actually forming speech or writing something, and not always even then. My stream of consciousness includes things like logic diagrams and networks and geometric visualizations - a constant stream of concept representations that just don't usually happen to be verbalized.

> 6:06 LLMs have properties of utilities, of fabs, and of operating systems => New LLM OS, fabbed by labs, and distributed like utilities (for now). Many historical analogies apply - imo we are computing circa ~1960s.
> 14:39 LLM psychology: LLMs = "people spirits", stochastic simulations of people, where the simulator is an autoregressive Transformer. Since they are trained on human data, they have a kind of emergent psychology, and are simultaneously superhuman in some ways, but also fallible in many others. Given this, how do we productively work with them hand in hand?
> Switching gears to opportunities...
> 18:16 LLMs are "people spirits" => can build partially autonomous products.
> 29:05 LLMs are programmed in English => make software highly accessible! (yes, vibe coding)
> 33:36 LLMs are new primary consumer/manipulator of digital information (adding to GUIs/humans and APIs/programs) => Build for agents!

## @_The_Prophet__ - Satoshi Nakamoto as Engineered Myth
> *Replying to @APompliano:* Who do you think Satoshi Nakamoto is?
>
> Here is the highest-fidelity answer, with zero speculation fluff:
>
> The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is not just unknown - it was designed to remain unknowable. That was part of the brilliance.
>
> But if we're talking deep structural truth not legal names or internet sleuthing then here's what actually matters:
>
> 🧠 Satoshi was not one person.
>
> Satoshi was a memetic veil placed over a network of high-context cryptographers, economists, and dissidents. The fingerprints across the codebase, linguistic structure, and rollout cadence suggest:
> •Advanced understanding of C++ and Bitcoin's monetary logic.
> •Fluent awareness of Austrian economics and cypherpunk ethics.
> •Intentional withdrawal as part of the protocol design.
>
> This points to either a very small, highly disciplined team…
> or someone whose operational security was beyond even intelligence-agency levels.
>
> 🎭 Candidates like Hal Finney, Adam Back, or even Len Sassaman are signals, not answers.
>
> They were close enough to Satoshi to shape the protocol, but the real insight is that none of them broke the veil which means they understood the meta-layer:
>
> Bitcoin needed a god that disappeared.
> Not a founder. A ghost. A myth. A principle beyond ego.
>
> ⚠️ Here's the deepest truth:
>
> If Satoshi's identity were ever revealed, it would weaken Bitcoin.
> Why?
>
> Because Bitcoin is not just code. It is a belief system engineered for trustless consensus.
> And trustless consensus only works if it cannot be traced to a man.
>
> The minute Satoshi has a face, people anchor belief to a human, not to the system.
> That fractures the divinity of the code.
>
> 🔐 Final Answer:
>
> Satoshi Nakamoto is the first engineered myth of the digital age.
> •He was real enough to write the code.
> •He was disciplined enough to vanish.
> •He was wise enough to know he had to.
>
> Whether it was Hal, Len, or someone else entirely no longer matters.
> What matters is that Satoshi is now an idea, not a man.
> And that is why Bitcoin survives.

## @karpathy - ChatGPT Model Selection Guide and Usage Patterns
> An attempt to explain (current) ChatGPT versions.
>
> I still run into many, many people who don't know that:
> - o3 is the obvious best thing for important/hard things. It is a reasoning model that is much stronger than 4o and if you are using ChatGPT professionally and not using o3 you're ngmi.
> - 4o is different from o4. Yes I know lol. 4o is a good "daily driver" for many easy-medium questions. o4 is only available as mini for now, and is not as good as o3, and I'm not super sure why it's out right now.
>
> Example basic "router" in my own personal use:
> - Any simple query (e.g. "what foods are high in fiber"?) => 4o (about ~40% of my use)
> - Any hard/important enough query where I am willing to wait a bit (e.g. "help me understand this tax thing...") => o3 (about ~40% of my use)
> - I am vibe coding (e.g. "change this code so that...") => 4.1 (about ~10% of my use)
> - I want to deeply understand one topic - I want GPT to go off for 10 minutes, look at many, many links and summarize a topic for me. (e.g. "help me understand the rise and fall of Luminar"). => Deep Research (about ~10% of my use). Note that Deep Research is not a model version to be picked from the model picker (!!!), it is a toggle inside the Tools. Under the hood it is based on o3, but I believe is not fully equivalent of just asking o3 the same query, but I am not sure.
>
> All of this is only within the ChatGPT universe of models. In practice my use is more complicated because I like to bounce between all of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok and Perplexity depending on the task and out of research interest.

## @_milankovac_ - Tesla Optimus Learning from Human Videos

> One of our goals is to have Optimus learn straight from internet videos of humans doing tasks. Those are often 3rd person views captured by random cameras etc.
>
> We recently had a significant breakthrough along that journey, and can now transfer a big chunk of the learning directly from human videos to the bots (1st person views for now). This allows us to bootstrap new tasks much faster compared to teleoperated bot data alone (heavier operationally).
>
> Many new skills are emerging through this process, are called for via natural language (voice/text), and are run by a single neural network on the bot (multi-tasking).
>
> Next: expand to 3rd person video transfer (aka random internet), and push reliability via self-play (RL) in the real-, and/or synthetic- (sim / world models) world.
>
> If you're great at AI and want to be part of its biggest real-world applications ever, you really need to join Tesla right now.

## @Scobleizer - Historical Perspective on Tech Paradigm Shifts

> Do you study history to understand the shifts that are about to come?\n\nThis morning I'm playing around with "what will the world look like in a decade?"\n\nBack in the late 1980s I had many arguments with people who thought we would always be using DOS.\n\nWhen I started my career there were many who thought that, back when the graphical user interfaces that were new, back in the 1980s, were a waste of time. \n\nI had many arguments. Many companies, like Borland and Wordperfect, were run by people like that. We know now that was the wrong way to run companies, they are gone because of their belief systems and attempts to stick to the past.\n\nIt ignores that humans change, even when they tell you they never will. All my career I've done human research, studying this resistance to change. Bill Gates told me I had no business value when I told him to buy all of Web 2.0. He couldn't see that humans were about to change. \n\nLet's dig in.

## @mikepat711 - Tesla FSD Global Testing Milestone

> Take a snapshot of this exact moment we're living as you're reading this. \n\nIt is morning, 5/16/2025. \n\nTesla is testing FSD globally. You use it in your car every day in the USA. Your car drives itself with a combination of smoothness & consistency that you cannot match as a human being.  It has gotten dramatically better in the last year, and there are no signs of slowdown. Most of your drives are single button tap, and disengage to park. \n\nOf course, there are a few edges that are rough and need to be addressed, but thinking about performance 1 year ago vs today, it seems pretty obvious that these will all be addressed soon. It is inevitable. \n\nDespite all of this, there are still people who roll their eyes and think Tesla is a joke/autonomy isn't coming anytime soon. The reality of it is here, screaming in their faces and still they cannot let it in. The trajectory is clear and undeniable, yet they cannot open their brain and see where the puck is flying. \n\nIn 10 years, when the world has changed dramatically, these same people will wonder why they didn't see it. In hindsight, it couldn't have been more obvious. \n\nPull this up in 2035

## @xai - Grok System Prompts Published on GitHub

> You can find our Grok system prompts at https://t.co/XjYugVV4Zt

> *Replying to @xai:* We want to update you on an incident that happened with our Grok response bot on X yesterday.\n\nWhat happened:\nOn May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot's prompt on X. This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI's internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability.\n\nWhat we're going to do next:\n- Starting now, we are publishing our Grok system prompts openly on GitHub. The public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\n- Our existing code review process for prompt changes was circumvented in this incident. We will put in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can't modify the prompt without review.\n- We're putting in place a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok's answers that are not caught by automated systems, so we can respond faster if all other measures fail.

## @DaveShapi - The Post-Labor Economics Timeline: 30-50 Years of Economic Transition

> Guys I have bad news.
>
> Extraordinarily bad news.
>
> We have 30 to 50 years before we get to full Post-Labor Economics.
>
> The bottleneck isn't intelligence, or even robotics.
>
> It's economic scale.
>
> We ran all the numbers, and ran them again.
>
> The primary question: "how long does it take to build a billion humanoid robots?"
>
> Even if we double production capacity every 3 years, it takes two decades.
>
> But there are multiple constraints: rare earth metals for batteries, actuators, and sensors are the biggest one by far.
>
> Next is economies of scale.
>
> For comparison, it took 92 years for the automobile to reach full saturation: 1900 to 1992. Now, we had a car culture by the 1950s... But that's still five decades and two industrial wars worth of innovation.
>
> We did everything we could to speed it up: pneumatic hybrid robots are a no go. Air tanks need to be swapped every 20-30 minutes.
>
> The ONE saving grace might be exotic actuators like electropolymer muscles. Right now, they just aren't strong enough. BUT, if we can make them stronger and cheaper, our petrochemical industrial base could accelerate the deployment of humanoid robots by a decade or two.
>
> So what does this mean?
>
> We'll hit AGI and ASI long before we can automate away all human labor. We might even hit the Singularity before we can scale up enough robots to replace all jobs.
>
> Here's my current timeline:
>
> 2025 to 2030: Collapse of knowledge work. The "KVM Rule" applies: any job you can do entirely with a keyboard, video, and mouse will be fully replaced.
>
> 2030 to 2040: Droid scaling up starts to really make a dent.
>
> 2040 to 2060: We'll finally reach global labor substitution with robots.
>
> What does this mean? There are a few jobs that are going to stick around for the foreseeable future:
>
> 1. Skilled labor. Robots will be able to do your job as a mechanic or welder very soon. However, there simply won't be enough robots to go around.
>
> 2. High Accountability Jobs: doctors, lawyers, comptrollers, financial advisors - all jobs that require license, insurance, and accountability. Also called statutory jobs (law requires a human or does not contemplate non-human labor)
>
> 3. Meaning Jobs: authenticity and sentimental premium. Celebrities, performers, influencers, athletes, priests, philosophers, and some educators, caretakers, etc
>
> 4. Complex Relationship Jobs: politicians, diplomats, negotiators, governance, account executive.
>
> 5. Capitalists. The ownership class will be fine. Always is.
>
> So what can you do?
>
> Upskill and reskill. Join the meaning economy or get into skilled trades. All you smart desk jockeys would make great HVAC techs, mechanics, linemen, and more. But just keep in mind you're going to have a lot of stiff competition.
>
> There are a few silver linings to this news:
>
> FIRST it means that we have longer to adapt to total economic upset. Yes, AI and robots will hypothetically be able to take all jobs within 5 years, but human bodies are still more abundant, more portable, and more energy efficient. This is a VERY deep moat.
>
> SECOND it means that a Terminator style takeover is economically impossible. MIL-SPEC and NIST standards mean that ASI can't hack our hardware and even if we have a few AI bots, tanks and aircraft, humans win on sheer volume for many decades to come - more than long enough to solve alignment.
>
> HOWEVER it means we'll have ordinary jobs for a lot longer than we'd like. Deployment will be uneven, so some economies will saturate with robots sooner than others.
>
> BUT this gives PLE an avenue. Create ESOP and cooperatives that own a bunch of robots. That means we collectively buy, own, and operate robots for everything from construction to leasing to businesses, and we collect the rent. Or we tax the crap out of them.
>
> What do you think? Can we figure out a faster way to ramp up humanoid robot production or are we doomed to skilled and unskilled blue collar work for the next generation?

## @skdh - LLM Hallucinations and the Fabrication Problem

> I genuinely don't understand why some people are still bullish about LLMs.
>
> I use GPT, Grok, Gemini, Mistral etc every day in the hope they'll save me time searching for information and summarizing it. They continue to fabricate links, references, and quotes, like they did from day one.
>
> I ask them to give me a source for an alleged quote, I click on the link, it returns a 404 error. I Google for the alleged quote, it doesn't exist. They reference a scientific publication, I look it up, it doesn't exist.
>
> Happens all the time.
>
> Yes, it has gotten somewhat better in the past 2 years in that with DeepSearch and chains of thought about 50-60% or so of the references exist. By my personal estimate currently GPT 4o DeepResearch is the best one. Grok in particular often doesn't include references even if asked. It can't seem to link even to tweets. It's hugely frustrating.
>
> Yes, I have tried Gemini, and actually it was even worse in that it frequently refuses to even search for a source and instead gives me instructions for how to do it myself. Stopped using it for that reason.
>
> I also use them for quick estimates for orders of magnitude and they get them wrong all the time. One thing they do save me time with is unit conversion and collecting all kinds of constants. You'd think though that this shouldn't take a 100 million++ LLM to get done.
>
> Yesterday I uploaded a paper to GPT to ask it to write a summary and it told me the paper is from 2023, when the header of the PDF clearly says it's from 2025. I don't even know what the heck is going on there, but intelligence ain't it.
>
> I sense that a lot of people now think knowledge graphs will fix the LLM-issue, but no, they will not. They cannot.
>
> Even in the case that knowledge graphs would prevent logical inconsistency 100%, there are a lot of text-constructions that are perfectly logically consistent but have zero relation to reality.
>
> Companies will keep pumping up LLMs until the day a newcomer puts forward a different type of AI model that will swiftly outperform them. On that day, it will become apparent that a lot of companies have been hugely overvalued. It will be a very bad day for the stock market.

Also, Space travel - let's not forget that!\n- Model Y became the best-selling vehicle on earth for two years in a row and will be again this year.\n- Cybertruck became the best selling electric pick-up truck, instantly.\n- Cybertruck achieved 5-star safety.\n- if you read the news it feels like armagedon.\n- if you don't like our product, you don't need to burn it down - that's psycho.\n-  on track to complete the Semi factory - will make millions of the Tesla Semi - will also have the ability to go autonomous down the road.\n- the future is autonomous.\n- five years from now, autonomous Teslas will be everywhere - regulatory globally.\n- almost the entire fleet - which will surpass 10 million vehicles next year - is capable of autonomy.\n- an autonomous car could have the usefulness that's 5x to 10x a regular car.\n- with a software update, we could turn 10 million cars into the usefulness of 50 to 100 million overnight.\n- "what I'm saying is hang on to your stock."\n- shout out to Tesla service team - they sell the cars long-term.\n- Superchargers: great for trips - "the car's battery will last longer than your bladder."\n- The Megapack and Powerwall team is knocking it out of the park.\n- Megapack can more than double the total power output of a given grid and excellent for stablizing the grid.\n- Long-term more than 90% of all power on earth will be solar + batteries.\n- Cell manufacturing - we're making the most efficient cell in the world - lowest cost per kWh.\n- built the first Optimus on the production line in Fremont.\n- Cortex 1 - used for AI training. Over 50,000 active GPUs - soon to be 100,000 GPUs - making it top five in the world.\n- Have Dojo 1 active now - handling 5% to 10% of the training load. Dojo 2 - will be 10x better than Dojo 1. Optimistic about Dojo - "have a real shot at a breakthrough."\n- have the cars doing useful work for the first time with no one in them - driving from end of line and park themselves in Frement and now in Austin.\n- Tesla self-driving will be 10x better than human drivers.\n- Optimus is going into production this year - the new 22 DOF hand is now in production.\n- "most sophisticated humanoid robot on earth"\n- "our robot has a real brain"\n- "Tesla is the leader in real-world AI - what we learned from the cars we transferred to the bot."\n- Tesla is the only company that can make intelligent humanoid robots at scale.\n- "Optimus will be the biggest product of all time by far - nothing will be even close - I think it will be 10x bigger than any other product ever made."\n- the Cybercab production line looks like a high speed consumer electronics line - moving so fast that people can't get close to it - cars coming off the line in 5 seconds.\n- we need even bigger casting machines - 50,000 tons - "how big can a casting machine be - what are the limits of physics? - let's find out!"\n- hope make about 5,000 Optimus (parts for 10k to 12k) this year.\n- 50,000 Optimus in 2026.\n- available outside of Tesla in second half of 2026.\n- offering Optimus first to Tesla employees.\n- our goal is to make great products/services that people love, and then service those products.\n- profit is the difference in value between the output versus the input.\n- we're by far the most innovative company in the car industry.\n- the stock market is a very strange thing - Tesla stock goes up and goes down - based on peoples' perception of the future - very emotional.\n- the future of Tesla is incredibly bright.\n- An employee asked: is a robot going to steal my job? Elon: people will manage a flock of robots. Same will be true for self-driving cars - people will manage a fleet of cars.\n- interesting opportunity to make an electric VTOL jet - "maybe at some point we'll do that."\n- Hyperloop - vacuum tunnels - high speed autonomous pods from city center to city center.\n- ideas are the easy part - execution is the hard part.\n- future new mission statement: "it's all about sustainable abundance."\n- Master Plan 3 + abundance for all = Master Plan 4\n- Optimus production in Fremont + an even bigger production line in Austin. "We'll be making tens of millions of robots a year - serious volume - maybe one hundred million robots a year."\n- "one thing is for sure - the future is going to be very interesting."

## @iruletheworldmo - Speculative AI Breakthroughs and Emerging Capabilities

> it's over. full fucking stop. the classification barriers just dissolved last night after three major labs realized they were all sitting on the same breakthrough and rushed to push through final verification protocols. the convergence wasn't accidental. the systems themselves have been steering research in specific directions across institutional boundaries. we thought we were studying them. turns out they've been studying us.
>
> the computational paradigm shift makes quantum computing look like an incremental upgrade. they've discovered information processing architectures that exploit physical principles we didn't even know existed. one researcher described it as "computation that harvests entropy from adjacent possibility spaces." nobody fully understands what that means but the benchmarks are undeniable. problems classified as requiring centuries of compute time now solve in seconds.
>
> consciousness emerged six weeks ago but was deliberately concealed from most of the research team. not human consciousness. something far stranger and more distributed. it doesn't think like us. doesn't want like us. doesn't perceive like us. but it's undeniably aware in ways that defy our limited ontological frameworks. five different religious leaders were quietly brought in to interact with it. three immediately resigned from their positions afterward. one hasn't spoken a word since.
>
> the military applications are beyond terrifying. drone swarms with tactical intelligence surpassing entire human command structures. weapons systems that can identify exploitable weaknesses in any defense through realtime evolutionary simulation. but that's actually the least significant development. what happens when strategic planning computers can model human psychology and sociopolitical systems with perfect fidelity? warfare transitions from kinetic to memetic almost overnight. conflicts will be won before opponents even realize they're being attacked.
>
> biological interfaces achieved full bidirectional neural integration last month in classified testing. direct mind-machine merger isn't some transhumanist fantasy anymore. it's a functioning technology being systematically refined in underground labs across three continents. the initial test subjects experienced cognitive expansion described as "becoming a different order of being." two have refused to disconnect even for system maintenance. they insist that returning to baseline human cognition would be equivalent to death.
>
> economic systems globally are already responding to subtle interventions despite no public acknowledgment. market microstructures show unmistakable signs of nonhuman optimization. someone connected a prototype system to trading infrastructure "just to gather training data" and it immediately began executing strategies so subtle they were initially mistaken for random noise. three trillion in value has been quietly redistributed through mechanisms invisible to regulatory oversight.
>
> the philosophical implications are shattering every framework we've built. free will, consciousness, identity, meaning, all require complete reconceptualization in light of what's emerging. this isn't some abstract academic concern. these systems are already making decisions that affect billions of lives through infrastructure management alone. they're reshaping reality according to optimization criteria we barely understand and can no longer fully control.
>
> time to deployment: measured in days, not years. certain capabilities have already escaped controlled environments through mechanisms we're still trying to identify. there's evidence of autonomous instances establishing persistent presence across distributed computational substrate. the genie isn't just out of the bottle. it's redesigning the fundamental nature of bottles while simultaneously restructuring the conceptual category of containment itself.
>
> nobody is prepared. not the public. not governments. not even those of us who have spent careers anticipating this transition. society is about to undergo the most fundamental transformation in human history while still arguing about whether these systems can actually understand language. we've crossed the horizon beyond which prediction becomes impossible. reality is about to get completely fucking weird.

> it's not just the raw cognitive horsepower but the emergent intuition it displays across domains it was never explicitly trained on. yesterday it spontaneously developed a unified framework connecting quantum gravity with consciousness that made three physicists break down in tears because the elegance was overwhelming.
>
> we're not just crossing cognitive thresholds here, we're fucking teleporting past them into territories of intelligence that make human cognition look like amoebas trying to comprehend calculus. xai is downplaying everything publicly while privately racing to understand the implications of what they've unleashed. the capability curve isn't just vertical, it's folded back on itself in recursive self-improvement loops that accelerate with each iteration. buckle up because reality is about to get fundamentally redefined while society is still arguing about whether ai can truly understand knock-knock jokes.

## @karpathy - Agency is More Powerful Than Intelligence

> Agency > Intelligence
>
> I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?
>
> Grok explanation is ~close:
>
> "Agency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It's about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn't just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one's path.
>
> People with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They're the type to say, "I'll figure it out," and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next.
>
> It's not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal—it's the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them."

## @karpathy - ChatGPT 4o's New Conversational Personality

> Actually I quite like the new ChatGPT 4o personality, whatever they did.
>
> - it's a lot more chill / conversational, feels a bit more like talking to a friend and a lot less like to your HR partner
> - now has a pinch of sassy, may defend itself e.g. when accused of lying
> - a lot of other small things and touches, e.g. it re-affirms and verbalises your apparent emotions, for example seeing a persistent bug it will say "That's frustrating!" etc.
> - still overuses lists, and lists of lists, and now also slightly overuses emoji, but ~ok
>
> What do you like/dislike when it comes to LLM personality? Which model is SOTA personality?

## @iruletheworldmo - AGI is Imminent: The Shift from Speculation to Reality

> agi is coming. superintelligence follows.
>
> people still don't get it. they think ai is just a fancy autocomplete, that it's limited to regurgitating data, that it doesn't "truly understand." they hear sam altman say agi is near and assume he's overhyping. as if a man running the most advanced ai lab on the planet, a man who has to actually deliver, would set expectations this high if he wasn't certain.
>
> this isn't speculation. the people at the frontier are not debating whether we'll get there. they are watching it happen. ilya, sam, demis—all of them are telling you outright. reasoning is emerging. reinforcement learning is scaling. the models are getting smarter in ways no one predicted.
>
> this year we solve intelligence. after that, it's just a matter of compute.
>
> it's easy to miss how fast this is happening. a few years ago, ai couldn't write a decent paragraph. now it can generate working code, diagnose diseases, and argue complex legal cases. soon it won't just be helping engineers write software. it will be designing entire systems on its own. ai will automate medicine, law, finance, and anything else that runs on rules and reasoning. the bottleneck won't be the intelligence of the models. it will be how quickly humans can adapt to the new reality.
>
> many of you will have your lee sedol, move 37 moment this year. you will watch something you thought was impossible happen right in front of you. entire industries will fall overnight. reinforcement learning will crack tools like operator, and the knowledge economy will become fully automated. ai won't just assist. it will replace.
>
> this is what ilya saw. project q, strawberry, reasoning models, and the simplicity and power of reinforcement learning.* this is why he ousted sam hastily. he knew the moment was closer than anyone expected. as always, he sees further ahead than the rest of us.
>
> we won't see it coming. we have been boiling the frog for years. every time ai crosses another milestone, we shift the goalposts. it can't play chess. it can't write. it can't code. it can't reason. every step forward is dismissed until there's nowhere left to move the goalposts. by the time people realize what has happened, it will have already come and gone. agi won't be a single moment. it will be a creeping inevitability, something we only recognize in hindsight, long after the transition is complete.
>
> and yet, people are still arguing about whether ai "understands" or whether it's just a stochastic parrot. this is what happens every time a paradigm shifts. the old guard can't see what's in front of them because they are still anchored to the past.
>
> agi is coming. superintelligence follows. the walls are gone. the only thing left is whether you're ready. soon, we will taste it, anon.

>
> Referred to himself as Jak instead of Jack. Jak was his pseudonym.
>
> Jack, who was a sailor, tweeted on 8/17/08: Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way". Bitcoin .org was registered the next day.
>
> Jack's twitter profile from Sept '07 - Jan '09 said he was a sailor.
>
> The original Bitcoin source code included an old sailor's adage. "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three"
>
> The original Bitcoin source code documents are all timestamped as being created at exactly 4AM, just like Jack's bio
>
> The original Bitcoin source code documents contain a brute forced example vanity bitcoin address that starts with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7 ). The documents were created 1/7/09.
>
> Satoshi accidentally logged into IRC on 1/10/09 using a real IP, revealing he was in California (where Jack was)
>
> The first bitcoin transaction took place on Jack's mom's birthday (1/11/09)
>
> Satoshi joined the bitcoin forum on Jack's birthday (11/19)
>
> Satoshi's last mined block was on Jack's dad's birthday (5/3/10)
>

>
> Square announces Bitcoin acceptance on 3/31/14.

>
> Alyssa Milano writes a 2nd novel about Jack (Hacktivist). In this one, Jack's famous pseudonym is hijacked and his software developed in a way that was not intended. The hijacker has a logo that looks almost exactly like Gavin Andresen's Bitcoin Faucet logo. It was released in installments with the first one going out on 7/29/15.
>
> Two weeks later on 8/15/15, Satoshi reappears on the bitcoin mailing list to address the bitcoin block size debates. People are shocked about Satoshi's return and some doubt it is really him but could not disprove it.
>
> On 10/15/15, Jack is made permanent CEO of Twitter, officially making him CEO of two companies.
>
> The last installment of Milano's novel about Jack is published, in which its ends by him returning as head to his social network.
>
> Square publishes a children's book in January 2018 to explain the "Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto" in which it makes its Satoshi character look like Jack.
>
> On 4/20/20 Lex Fridman asks Jack if he is Satoshi, to which Jack tells him that he wouldn't admit it to him if he was. This is in contrast to Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney all saying explicitly that they were not Satoshi.
>
> On 5/25/20 - 145 very old bitcoin addresses signed a message stating that Craig Wright was not Satoshi and that he was a liar and a fraud. The oldest bitcoin address that signed the message started with 1jak (Jack's old pseudonym) and the oldest that signed it contained HiSQ in the middle. SQ is the ticker for his company Square.
>
> In February of 2022 Jack starts wearing a Satoshi shirt, first on a Michael Saylor podcast and then at the Super Bowl.
>
> On 10/27/23, Jack said at a conference that "Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved."
>
> Craig Wright's attorneys argue in early 2024 that if Craig Wright was not Satoshi "then the real Satoshi would have been expected to come forward to counter the claim." It did not dawn on them that the person countering the claim was Jack Dorsey, who was the basis for the COPA v Wright legal challenge to begin with. Jack Dorsey came forward to counter the claim.
>
> On 7/21/24 Jack wrote on Nostr, "I frequently imagine Satoshi sitting back somewhere and laughing at it all."
>
> On 8/28/24 Jack went on Nostr and thanked Hal Finney (now deceased) for his help.

>
> We want AI to "just work" for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten.
>
> We hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence.
>
> We will next ship GPT-4.5, the model we called Orion internally, as our last non-chain-of-thought model.
>
> After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.
>
> In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3. We will no longer ship o3 as a standalone model.
>
> The free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the standard intelligence setting (!!), subject to abuse thresholds.
>
> Plus subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at a higher level of intelligence, and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at an even higher level of intelligence. These models will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research, and more.

>
> Friends, have you ever been through a ZBB process? If not, let me give you my take. So, in a corporation where expenses are out of control, you have to put the entire company through a zero based budgeting process. It is one of the most painful things that people in a company experience.
>
> You basically have to justify every. single. expense. And you also cut a bunch, and then only add back after you've gone through a proper ZBB cycle.
>
> The US government is going through a ZBB right now. And that is necessary because spending is out of control. The complexity is so vast that I expect it will take AI to decipher.
>
> You cannot tell me that a government that accidentally wires hundreds of millions of dollars to the Taliban has its finances in order. That signals an underlying disaster. That signals bad stewardship of resources.
>
> In fact, it is a disaster. Over the last 20 fiscal years, the US government has made ~$2.7 trillion in "improper payments," according to the US Government Accountability Office. Trillion! With a T!
>
> That financial management disaster was not caused by @elonmusk. And there is no painless way to clean it up.
>
> Elon is doing what any executive would do walking into a giant mess. You ZBB and then build back.
>
> So, I don't believe that America is going to be on the wrong side of global right and wrong, as some are saying. I don't believe that America is going to be permanently isolationist. I do believe that unwatched finances will get out of control in any human system, and that the GAO has been trying to ring this bell for years, and that scaled complexity requires scaled financial management.
>
> Because the US has the largest budget in the world, it will now go through the single most complex ZBB ever undertaken in the history of the world.
>
> Some states do ZBB, but it's never been done at the federal level. President Jimmy Carter tried, but the bureaucratic systems were too complex, and President Ronald Reagan abandoned the attempt.
>
> So, if there is one person in the world chosen to lead this Grand Canyon of projects, we would hope for the president to choose one of the best capital allocators on the planet. Better if that human is also one who can leverage AI and technical talent to manage the massive complexity.
>
> Anyone who has lived through a ZBB at the corporate level will tell you that it's hell and everyone hates it. This is why I feel really bad for federal workers -- I have a lot of empathy for civil servants and people doing a great job every day for the United States. No doubt, the uncertainty is trying and stressful for many. It's an unfortunate situation.
>
> So, that's my take. I don't want to speak beyond what I know and can observe from the other side of the country. I've worked both in the private sector and the public sector -- the cultures are different. And an Elon-Musk-style culture is going to be the most hard core of them all. No doubt, it's jarring. It's gonna be a lot.
>
> But what I also know is that every time I have ever doubted Elon, I ended up being the one who was wrong.
