## @esrtweet - 50 Years of Programming Progress: From Punched Cards to AI
> I was writing some code the new-school way yesterday, prompting gpt-4.1 through aider, and for whatever reason my mind flashed back 50 years and the utter freaking enormity of it all crashed in on me like a tidal wave.
>
> And now I want to make you feel that, too.
>
> In 1975 I ran programs by feeding punched cards into a programmable calculator. Actual computers were still giant creatures that lived in glass-walled rooms, though there were rumors from afar of a thing called an Altair.
>
> Unix and C had not yet broken containment from Bell Lab; DOS and the first IBM PC were six years away. The aggregated digital computing capacity of the entire planet was roughly equivalent to a single modern smartphone.
>
> We still used Teletypes as production gear because even video character terminals barely existed yet; pixel-addressable color displays on computers were a science-fiction dream.
>
> We didn't have version control. Public forge sites wouldn't be a thing for 25 years yet. The number of computer games that existed in the world could probably be counted on the fingers of two hands.
>
> Because of all this, I learned to program over the next ten years with tools so primitive that when I talk about them today it sounds like uphill-both-ways sketch comedy.
>
> You may not even be able to imagine what a slow and laborious process programming was then, and how tiny the volume of code we could produce per month was; I have to work to remember it, myself.
>
> Today I call spirits from the vasty deep, conversing with unhuman intelligences and belting out finished programs I would once have considered prohibitively complex to attempt within a single working day.
>
> Fifty years, many generations of hardware technology, from punched cards to AIs that can pass the Turing test...and I'm still here, still coding, still on top of what a software engineer needs to know to get useful work done in the current day. Gotta admit I feel some pride in that!
>
> This meditation isn't supposed to be about me, though. It's about the dizzying, almost unbelievable progress I've lived through and been a part of. If you had told me to predict when I would have a device in my pocket that would give me instant real-time access to most of the world's knowledge, with my own pet homunculi to sift through it for me, I would have been one of the few that wouldn't have said "never" (because I was already a science-fiction fan), but I wouldn't have predicted a date fewer than multiple centuries in the future either.
>
> We've come a hell of a long way, baby. And the fastest part of the ride is only beginning. The Singularity is upon us. Everything I've lived through and learned was just prologue.

## @bcherny - Claude Code's Impact: 259 PRs and the Future of Software Engineering
> When I created Claude Code as a side project back in September 2024, I had no idea it would grow to be what it is today. It is humbling to see how Claude Code has become a core dev tool for so many engineers, how enthusiastic the community is, and how people are using it for all sorts of things from coding, to devops, to research, to non-technical use cases. This technology is alien and magical, and it makes it so much easier for people to build and create. Increasingly, code is no longer the bottleneck.
>
> A year ago, Claude struggled to generate bash commands without escaping issues. It worked for seconds or minutes at a time. We saw early signs that it may become broadly useful for coding one day.
>
> Fast forward to today. In the last thirty days, I landed 259 PRs -- 497 commits, 40k lines added, 38k lines removed. Every single line was written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5. Claude consistently runs for minutes, hours, and days at a time (using Stop hooks). Software engineering is changing, and we are entering a new period in coding history. And we're still just getting started..

## @karpathy - The Paradigm Shift in Modern Programming with AI

> I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.

## @CryptoNagato - Analysis: Why Crypto Is Not Dead Despite Current Market Sentiment
> Yesterday I was in a taxi, on my way to Christmas dinner, casually scrolling X.
>
> I wasn't even looking for content.
> And then I saw this guy.
>
> Absolutely convinced he cracked the code.
>
> His thesis?
>
> "Nobody wants crypto anymore.
> The old crypto crowd moved to prediction markets and stocks.
> Crypto is dead.
> Nobody will ever come back."
>
> And I'm reading this thinking:
>
> You have to be completely sleepwalking through life to believe this, but the real comedy is thinking it's an intelligent take.
>
> Let me ask you something.
>
> In 2021, during the biggest crypto bull run ever (in terms of global adoption)… why do you think everyone suddenly loved crypto?
>
> Was it the tech?
> The philosophy?
> The decentralized utopia?
>
> Or was it simply because everything was going up like crazy and people dreamed of becoming millionaire instantly?
>
> Be honest.
>
> Do you think people were buying NFTs because they believed in the "future of digital art"?
>
> Or because you could buy any random JPEG and 10x your net worth in two days?
>
> Exactly.
>
> It's always the same story:
>
> Greed.
> Speculation.
> Easy money.
>
> Nothing else.
>
> Now fast-forward to today.
>
> Crypto PA has been nuked for 2–3 years.
>
> 95% of the magic internet coins look completely dead.
>
> No easy money.
>
> No cheap dopamine.
>
> So what happens?
>
> People get bored.
> People get tired.
> People leave.
>
> They chase stocks at all-time highs.
> They chase prediction markets.
> They chase metals.
> They chase whatever just pumped.
>
> Which is… normal behavior for (allow me the technicism) retards.
>
> Because when money isn't easy anymore, the majority can't think beyond the next candle.
>
> Meanwhile, behind the scenes:
>
> Adoption keeps growing.
> Infrastructure keeps improving.
> Institutions keep positioning.
>
> But retail doesn't care about that.
> Retail only cares after the chart goes vertical.
>
> Same with stocks.
> Same with gold.
>
> Gold was "boring" when you could buy it for a third of today's price.
>
> Now it's at highs and suddenly it's:
>
> "Financial freedom.
> Safe haven.
> Smart money."
>
> No, you're just late to the party.
>
> You're not investing.
> You're chasing pumps.
>
> And guess where you can still position before real liquidity comes and the upside actually happens?
>
> Yes.
> Magic internet money industry.
>
> So all these people screaming "crypto is dead" at the bottom?
>
> They have zero understanding of capital rotation.
>
> Zero understanding of macro & liquidity cycles.
>
> Zero understanding of how money actually moves.
>
> To conclude this quick Xmas rent:
>
> If you want to sell your crypto here to chase stocks or precious metals after the monstrous uptrends they already had, it's your call.
>
> But, in a few months from now, there is a high chance you will regret this decision.
>
> So, before letting idiots on X convince you to abandon the most undervalued industry in this time in history, maybe (just maybe) do some research on what crypto can become in the next 5/10 years.
>
> Look at the mega-trend behind it.
>
> That's all.
>
> Wish you all a wonderful Christmas.

> ✅ Speed Profiles seem good, but Standard was about as fast as Hurry usually is. Not complaining, but definitely felt like Chill was a tad too slow as Standard was faster than I'm used to.
>
> ✅ Had several occasions during heavier traffic on I-695 where the car would signal to change lanes and hesitate. At one point, it straddled the line a tad too long for my liking; I said, "Make up your mind" out loud. A few of the hesitations were warranted; people drive insanely fast on 695. I didn't feel stressed or upset with its decision-making at any point, even with the lane changing.
>
> ✅ One thing I noticed today that would be a great feature would be to follow a car. I followed my parents home after meeting them and there wasn't a Speed Profile that allowed me to keep up. It either wanted to pass them or it would not keep up. A follow mode would be a great touch if it could be refined.

## @theswansjr - Money as a Shared Hallucination

> Money does not exist in nature.
>
> If every human vanished tomorrow—poof, Thanos snap—money dies with us.
>
> Not slowly. Instantly.
>
> Because money isn't real. It's not gravity. It's not water. It's not some fundamental law of physics carved into the universe's source code.
>
> Gravity pulls planets whether you believe in it or not. Water cycles through ecosystems without asking for permission. Those are natural phenomena. They persist.
>
> Money? Money is a shared hallucination. A collective delusion we all agreed to participate in because the alternative, pure barter, was a logistical nightmare.
>
> Look around. Animals hoard food. Birds collect shiny objects to attract mates. Squirrels bury acorns.
>
> But they're not pricing those acorns in "nut dollars." There's no interest rate on stored seeds. No squirrel is taking out a loan to front-run winter scarcity.
>
> That's instinct. That's biology. That's not money.
>
> Money only exists when humans assign value to something and agree that it represents stored labor, future purchasing power, or social coordination at scale.
>
> Without minds to recognize it, gold is just a shiny metal in the ground. Bitcoin is just dormant code on dead servers.
>
> Carl Menger figured this out in the 1870s. Money emerges organically from human action and voluntary agreement—not government decree, not divine mandate.
>
> Gold became money because humans decided it had the right properties: scarce, durable, divisible, portable, verifiable. We built entire civilizations around that consensus.
>
> But here's the kicker: gold isn't inherently money without us assigning it that role.
>
> It's just element 79 on the periodic table.
>
> Bitcoin? Same deal. It's a digital construct we engineered because we needed better properties for a global, hyperconnected world.
>
> But in a human-less universe? Bitcoin's ledger halts. The network dies. The protocol becomes a fossil record of a species that once tried to escape monetary debasement.
>
> This is the part most people miss:
>
> The evolution of money doesn't happen because it's etched into the fabric of reality. It happens because we build it. We improve it. We upgrade the operating system.
>
> Seashells → Gold → Paper → Digital.
>
> Each iteration solves problems the previous one couldn't. Each step is a reflection of human ingenuity, not natural inevitability.
>
> And right now, we're in the middle of the biggest monetary upgrade in human history.
>
> Bitcoin isn't "real" in the sense that it exists independent of us. But neither is the dollar. Neither is gold as money.
>
> The difference is Bitcoin was engineered—deliberately, mathematically, incorruptibly—to be the best form of money humans have ever created.
>
> 21 million hard cap. No central authority. No counterparty risk. No inflation. No debasement.
>
> It's not real because it's natural. It's real because we made it that way.
>
> And that's the point.

## @PhilWhittlesee - Tesla FSD with Grok AI Route Navigation
> Obligatory Tesla update, because this is just so cool:
>
> I had a doctor appointment, and was using the navigation and full-self-driving feature to get me there. It is off one of the main streets in the town, but from the direction I'm coming it is impossible to turn into the parking lot due to a concrete median. So, annoyingly, the navigation software always mandates a U-turn.
>
> That would be mostly fine, but in the past the FSD software has trouble with that U-turn. It needs to pull further into the intersection to pull it off, but it never used to, necessitating a reverse to complete it. It might not do that anymore, I'm not sure (it has been a while since I've taken it to that location, and FSD has been updated several times since then and is a lot better), but I didn't want to mess with it.
>
> I remembered that the most recent update, the 2025 Christmas update, integrated Grok into the navigation system, and you can use Grok voice prompts to adjust your route, add or remove stops, etc. I decided to give that a try.
>
> So I pull up Grok and ask it if can see my destination and route. It confirms that it can, gives me the address, etc. I ask if it can see the U-turn programmed in, and it confirms it with the intersection. I ask it to convert that u-turn to a left-hand-turn instead, and then to proceed about half a block, and then add a new left turn, which will take me into the parking lot via an alternate method.
>
> Easy. Grok does it. Says it has done it. Asks if it looks correct on the screen. The screen zooms in to show the new route in that area. It looks perfect. I say, "Yep, that looks good, execute that." And when we get there, it does!
>
> Coolest damn thing I've seen an AI do. The car drove itself, the AI accessed the data, adjusted the route based on my descriptions and satellite images, and then the car executed it. That is true, agentic AI functioning in my Model Y.

## @AdamBLiv - Inflation as Mass Wealth Extraction System
> Inflation is the most successful system of mass wealth extraction ever created.
>
> You can trivialize it as prices rising, but it's really because human time is monetized, stored, then quietly destroyed.
>
> The United States has roughly 160 million workers.
>
> The average full-time worker supplies ~1,800 hours per year.
>
> That is ~288 billion hours of human labor produced annually.
>
> Those hours are not abstract.
>
> They are pieces of human life.
>
> Now apply "normal" inflation.
>
> At 3% annual inflation, the dollar loses ~59% of its purchasing power over 30 years.
>
> Only ~41% remains.
>
> This means nearly three-fifths of the value of stored labor is erased, not because productivity fell, but because the unit measuring it was diluted.
>
> No vote. No consent. No line item on a paycheck.
>
> This is a tax of your saved time, the most finite asset you have.
>
> The mechanism is simple:
>
> Persistent government deficits
> Debt compounding faster than productivity
> Currency expansion to service that debt
> Past labor quietly paying present obligations
>
> Your savings do not fail. They are reassigned.
>
> Inflation allows the state to consume yesterday's work to fund today's promises, while the cost is diffused across the population.
>
> Prudence becomes a liability.
>
> Bitcoin breaks this equation.
>
> Fixed supply. No central issuer.
>
> No mechanism to dilute past labor.
>
> Bitcoin allows economic energy to be stored without decay.
>
> It is time that cannot be quietly stolen.
>
> That is why it matters.
>
> That is why it spreads.

## @karpathy - Understanding LLMs as Simulators, Not Entities

> Don't think of LLMs as entities but as simulators. For example, when exploring a topic, don't ask: "What do you think about xyz"? There is no "you". Next time try: "What would be a good group of people to explore xyz? What would they say?" The LLM can channel/simulate many perspectives but it hasn't "thought about" xyz for a while and over time and formed its own opinions in the way we're used to. If you force it via the use of "you", it will give you something by adopting a personality embedding vector implied by the statistics of its finetuning data and then simulate that. It's fine to do, but there is a lot less mystique to it than I find people naively attribute to "asking an AI".

## @niccruzpatane - Jensen Huang's First NVIDIA Customer Story: Elon and OpenAI

> NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said @elonmusk was there for him as a customer when nobody else was.

"When I announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it. I had no purchase orders—not one. Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it, except for Elon. He was at the event, and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars. And he goes, "You know what? I have a company that could really use this." And I said, "Wow, my first customer." I was pretty excited about it. And he goes, "Yeah, we have this company. It's a non-profit company", and all the blood drained out of my face. I had just spent a few billion dollars building this thing. It cost $300,000. And the chances of a non-profit being able to pay for this thing were approximately zero, and he goes, "You know, it's an AI company, and it's a non-profit. And we could really use one of these supercomputers."

So I picked it up. I built the first one for ourselves—we're using it inside the company. I boxed one up, drove it up to San Francisco, and delivered it to Elon in 2016. I walked up to the second floor, where they were all kind of crammed into a room smaller than this place here, and that place turned out to be OpenAI."

## @PTrubey - Tesla's AI5 Chip Ambitions and Samsung Transition

> Recently found out that Tesla's upcoming AI5 inference chip that will power Tesla's FSD in cars and Optimus is a much more ambitious chip than AI4 was.
>
> AI4 extensively used Samsung's SoC blocks like ARM CPU cores, SRAM, memory controllers, power management, while Tesla just provided the neural net accelerator design.
>
> For AI5, Tesla is designing the ENTIRE chip for extreme integration between all the blocks to squeeze the most out of the silicon. No more relying on SoC components from Samsung's design library.
>
> This is why it's taken so long to get AI5 designed, and also why Tesla thinks AI6 (and AI7) can be produced in a yearly cadence afterwards. Tesla took a huge time penalty to create a bunch of new silicon IP, which they can much more quickly leverage for follow on chips.
>
> Expect to hear rumors of a bunch of chip bugs when they get their first AI5 chip manufactured in the spring - you've got to expect that to occur in a top to bottom chip redesign. They'll fix and iterate the silicon, but each new chip is like a 3-4 month cycle (it takes that long to manufacture a new chip from an updated design).

## @cybrtrkguy - FSD 14.2 Winter Driving Analysis
> FSD 14.2 STUNS IN WINTER DRIVING!
>
> Just got done driving ~100 miles on a snowy interstate and a little suburban driving. A few notes:
>
> FSD absolutely, definitively detects snow as a separate substance from rain.
>
> As the snow began to fall, there came a point where FSD first detected the snow and immediately slowed. From then on, it drove in a *completely different profile*.
>
> Generally, V14.2 kept 40-55mph on a 70mph interstate.
>
> When driving in Sloth/Chill and you try to increase the speed profile to Standard/Hurry, the truck displays a red error saying inclement weather is preventing FSD from speeding up. Fantastic!
>
> V14.2 takes corners slow as molasses to keep traction.
>
> It does NOT shoot gaps and pull out in front of other vehicles. V14.2 waits for BIG gaps to make its merge into traffic. It is properly cautious!
>
> One instance of Red Hands occurred when it was merging into a center left turn lane. This center lane was the only lane not plowed, so either 1. it got confused with lane markings or 2. Slid sideways very slightly and got upset.
>
> On straightaways on the interstate in areas with little snow coverage, V14.2 would speed up close to the speed limit. While the roads were wet today from road treatment, I was concerned for slick & frozen areas and manually backed off on the speed. While not technically unsafe, I did this out of an abundance of caution. IMO this is a grey area between "driving safely" and "not driving how I do" lol
>
> Not much ice today. Just snow and slush.
>
> ***Tonight, 6-12 inches of fresh snow is forecasted to fall here. I'll be out at dawn tomorrow to test in worse conditions with less traffic.***
>
> Stay tuned.

- **What:** Detailed real-world testing of Tesla FSD 14.2 in winter conditions (100 miles on snowy interstate). FSD adapts driving profile for snow, reduces speed to 40-55mph, avoids aggressive merging, and prevents speed increases in inclement weather. One incident of Red Hands on unplowed lane.

## @_avichawla - AI Pentesting Framework Strix Automates Security Testing
> Pentesting firms don't want you to see this.
>
> An open-source AI agent just replicated their $50k service.
>
> A "normal" pentest today looks like this:
>
> - $20k-$50k per engagement
> - 4-6 weeks of scoping, NDAs, kickoff calls
> - A big PDF that's outdated the moment you ship a new feature
>
> Meanwhile, AI agents are quietly starting to perform on-par with human pentester on the stuff that actually matters day-to-day:
>
> ↳ Enumerating attack surface
> ↳ Fuzzing endpoints
> ↳ Chaining simple vulns into real impact
> ↳ Producing PoCs and remediation steps developers can actually use
>
> And they do it in hours instead of weeks and at a fraction of the cost.
>
> This approach is actually implemented in Strix, a recently-trending open-source framework (14k+ stars) for AI pentesting agent.
>
> The framework spins up a team of AI "attackers" that probe your web apps, APIs, and code.
>
> It then returns validated findings with exploit evidence, remediation steps, and a full PDF report that looks exactly like what you'd get from a traditional firm, but without a $50k invoice and a month-long wait time.
>
> You can see the full implementation on GitHub and try it yourself.
>
> Just run: `strix --target https: //your-app .com` and you are good to go.
>
> Human red teams aren't disappearing but the routine pentest (pre-launch, post-refactor, quarterly checks) is clearly shifting to AI.
>
> Strix is one of the first tools that makes that shift feel real instead of hypothetical.
>
> I've shared the GitHub repo in the replies.

## @karpathy - Gemini 3 Early Access Impressions and Model Testing
> I played with Gemini 3 yesterday via early access. Few thoughts -

> First I usually urge caution with public benchmarks because imo they can be quite possible to game. It comes down to discipline and self-restraint of the team (who is meanwhile strongly incentivized otherwise) to not overfit test sets via elaborate gymnastics over test-set adjacent data in the document embedding space. Realistically, because everyone else is doing it, the pressure to do so is high.

> Optimus— AI's Killer App
>
> This might be my most consequential post of the year.

> Tesla's AI team has been grinding for years on one of the hardest technical problems of our time: vehicle autonomy. It's the little team that could— while everyone else chased prestige, giant paychecks, and the chance to bask in the presence of the supposed "AI gods" at the likes of Google and Meta, this group stayed focused and solved autonomy the unglamorous way: pixel by pixel, version by version. That's what real engineering looks like.
>
> But what they've built isn't just for driving. It's the foundation for Optimus.
>
> Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) recently pointed out that today's "chatbot interface" is a temporary phase, much like text-based computers before the revolutionary Macintosh ushered in the graphical interface, and before the iPhone redefined the very idea of a personal device. Interfaces evolve, and they evolve toward whatever delivers the most utility— and sometimes present in novel ways.
>
> Embodied AI is that next interface. It is the interface of AI.
>
> A humanoid robot, Optimus, will be the breakthrough. A natural voice interface, a physical human-like presence, and the ability to manipulate the real world as we do. It's AI you don't just talk to; it's AI that does things. This will be how most people on Earth interact with artificial intelligence: not through a screen, but through a physical assistant that feels as natural as interacting with another person.
>
> Most people didn't see that "the phone" would become the dominant computing device. It looked like a communication tool— until the iPhone turned it into the center of modern life. Today, more people will read this post on a smartphone than on a computer.
>
> Optimus will be the same kind of shift.
>
> And it's Tesla's AI team that's positioned to deliver it. A fully embodied intelligence with the reasoning of top-tier chatbots and the physical competence of a human. Yes, it will likely integrate pieces of Grok from @xAI. But the core— its ability to perceive, navigate, and act in the real world— comes from Tesla's autonomy stack and its unmatched real-world data engine.

As described in our technical report, Kosmos' world model allows it to process orders of magnitude more information than could fit into the context of even the longest-context language models, allowing it to synthesize more information and pursue coherent goals over longer time horizons than Robin or any of our other prior agents. In this respect, we believe Kosmos is the most compute-intensive language agent released so far in any field, and by far the most capable AI Scientist available today...

## @elonmusk - Tesla AI5 Chip Production Timeline and Roadmap
> *Replying to @BrianRoemmele:* The new Tesla AI5 chip
>
> In-house design
> 40× faster
> 8× compute
> 9× memory
> 5× bandwidth
> Code paths shrunk to ~5
> 10× cheaper per inference than Nvidia
> 3× more efficient per watt
>
> Built by Samsung with lithography by TSMC all performed in Texas and Arizona.
>
> Production 2026.
>
> It is a big deal.
>
> Slightly different versions of the Tesla AI5 chip will be made at TSMC and Samsung simply because they translate designs to physical form differently, but the goal is that our AI software works identically.
>
> We will have samples and maybe a small number of units in 2026, but high volume production is only possible in 2027.
>
> AI6 will use the same fabs, but achieve roughly 2X performance. Aiming for a fast follow to AI5, so hopefully mid 2028 for volume production of AI6.
>
> AI7 will need different fabs, as it is more adventurous.

## @Scobleizer - Tesla's Robot Training Advantage Through Factory Data Collection
> I've been visiting as many robotics companies as I can in San Francisco.  And elsewhere (next week I'm heading to Abu Dhabi to meet technologists who are doing the same there).
>
> Understanding how robots are trained is leading me to a new thesis:
>
> Tesla will be able to do everything that @1x_tech showed, and much much more, but completely autonomously, by the end of next year.
>
> Why?
>
> The 12,000 workers at Tesla's Fremont Factory (it's first factory, and where Optimus is being designed).
>
> Remember the workers who used to drive cars from the end of the factory line to where they get loaded on carriers to be delivered to customers around the United States?
>
> Why haven't we seen any of them say "I got laid off today?"
>
> Or try to organize us to be anti robots or anti AI?
>
> Because they are doing what @1x_tech's first customers are doing: cleaning dishes, watering plants, doing laundry, but more importantly, helping teams working with others on the factory floor capture the data from workers on the factory floor, among other tasks.
>
> Every robot company tells me they don't have enough data to "go generalized."
>
> And this data collection doesn't need a highly skilled AI genius with a PhD from Carnegie Mellon. It just needs an organization of people who are doing the same kinds of tasks over and over, while being watched by a camera, or teleoperating a robot, or wearing sensors on their fingers as they do something more advanced than picking up a trash can.
>
> And then that data must be tagged properly. This is a skill that requires a little bit of human intelligence, but not much. At @1x_tech's launch party the other night I met a guy who runs a company that does that kind of tagging.
>
> It's not work that requires a whole lot of human intelligence. You need to bring a video, captured on the factory floor, into a computer screen, and then you need to manually tag everything that's happening in the video. A multi-modal AI does most of that work, so you just need to check what it perceived carefully and maybe add some more details. Like if it says a trash can was full, but it perceived that a little wrong, you fix it to say, "actually that's 7/8ths full." Accuracy matters, not smartness on the behalf of the human doing that work.
>
> Remember the guy I shared with you last week who is building a blackberry-picking robot at @fdotinc in San Francisco? That's exactly what he is doing. A lot of what he is doing to build the computer vision system that sees blackberries, and understands them, is just mind-numbing repetition. He's picking up blackberries with his robot over and over and over and over. And then tagging anything his AI systems get wrong.
>
> That's to build a robot that does ONE THING. Pick blackberries off of a bush and put them into a box.
>
> The thing is Elon has 12,000 people who are doing the same in the factory. One guy is connecting wires under the dash in a new Tesla. He does that every 45 seconds. All day long. I watched him work at Tesla's factory. And most workers building a car are doing something similar.
>
> Someone has to work with that guy to put a camera on his face, or sensors on his hands, to understand that task. But it is the worker who has value here in training the robot.
>
> Tesla has the worker. Figure does too, but in a far less efficient way (it had to partner with other companies to do the same) and 1x doesn't have either, so has to get people to buy the robot, to complete the data collection.
>
> Now 1x's approach might lead to understanding of homes that Tesla can't get. My dishwasher is slightly different than yours is. How I put plates into my cabinets is slightly different than yours is. So getting even 1,000 robots into homes will let 1x's NEO do the data collection on many homes, which will lead them to have a totally autonomous robot within three years too.
>
> But it comes down to "can you collect the data from many different humans and their lives?"
>
> Now, yes, we can simulate a whole lot of that. Last night I met a guy at @jowyang's AI startup launch event who can scan a factory floor, or my kitchen, bring it into a system, and do a lot of that training in a simulator with virtual beings. I'll have that video up in a bit.
>
> But Tesla has the best advantage here, with the best AI workflows and systems, which is why Tesla's cars are self driving in my neighborhood and no others are.
>
> I see it as the only company that has a credible shot at competing with the Chinese head on. Oh, and Tesla has another factory in China with another 12,000 workers. And another factory in Europe with another 12,000 workers. And another factory in Austin with another 12,000 workers. And another few factories in Nevada and New York and elsewhere. The Chinese don't. And neither does anyone else in San Francisco building robots.
>
> So, by 2030, who do you think has the robot that does the most?
>
> My thesis is Tesla.
>
> Do you have another thesis? Bring it on. Explain to me how you will collect all the data.
>
> I once interviewed the innovation team at Volkswagen. I asked "when are you going to put a camera on your workers to train AI's?" They said "we can't do that due to labor laws." In Detroit I asked the same and heard "Unions are hard to deal with."
>
> The Fremont Factory has no Union. Why not? Because the traditional automakers laid them off, so they hate the Unions. And are highly innovative, which is why they are compensated far better than any other automaker workers in the world.
>
> They are training robots. And building robots.
>
> And next year you will see their work. By 2030 I don't believe anyone will be able to compete with them.
>
> Tell me why I'm wrong.
>
> *Quoting @elonmusk:* Great @Tesla_Optimus engineering & manufacturing review today!
>
> Imagine having your personal C-3PO & R2-D2 … Optimus will be even better.

## @Sykodelic_ - Gold vs Bitcoin Rotation Theory

I don't understand how so many people can't see it.

GOLD added over $300bn to its market cap today.

Just today.

It's been adding an entire Bitcoin market cap in ONE WEEK!

And people keep saying "wHeRe Is ThE MoNeY GoNna CoMe FroM bRo" ?

I don't understand how most cannot see that as soon as GOLD stalls, BTC is going to rip.

It is the most obvious rotation stunt from
big money.

BTC is being held down on purpose so big money can run up GOLD and rinse it for as much as they can…

At the same time as shaking out every single Crypto holder and getting them to FOMO sell their bags to chase GOLD and stocks…

And then they'll top out GOLD using the normies as exit liquidity, and then rotate into and pump the fuck out of BTC.

Running that higher than most can imagine.

BTC and crypto isn't stalling because it's over…

That is what they WANT you to think.

It's stalling because they're holding it down for maximum pain, liquidating us all, and then buying up and running it up turbo once everyone has given up.

Understand this and stop being a retard.

You're welcome.

## @TheRealPlanC - Bitcoin Quantile Model v2 Release

The wait is over!

Introducing... 🥁

Bitcoin Quantile Model v2.

You're going to want to bookmark this post—and follow for regular model updates.

After months of research and development, I'm very proud of this model—my flagship quantile framework.

I'm confident it's one of the best—if not the best—long-term Bitcoin investment frameworks available.

As a full-time, unpaid Bitcoin researcher, I'm often asked how people can best support my free content.

Simply bookmark, repost, and comment on my posts :)

Thanks for all your continued support!

— PlanC

Key Features & Improvements:

1. Quantile lines never cross—mathematically impossible.

2. Cycle-length agnostic.

3. 133,000+ data points and 1,500 lines of code.

4. Fits and stores 999 quantile levels (τ = 0.001–0.999 in 0.001 steps) and identifies which level the last price is closest to.

5. Fits the two leading decay functions (stretched exponential decay & exponential decay) and selects the better fit via quantile-appropriate AIC.

Uses Akaike weights to identify the best-supported model.

Akaike weights (AIC-based):
Stretched exponential decay: 96.4%
Exponential decay: 3.6%

6. Piecewise Quantile Regression — Linear + Stretched Exponential Decay (Nonlinear).

## @karpathy - nanochat: Full-Stack ChatGPT Clone from Scratch
> Excited to release new repo: nanochat!
> (it's among the most unhinged I've written).
>
> Unlike my earlier similar repo nanoGPT which only covered pretraining, nanochat is a minimal, from scratch, full-stack training/inference pipeline of a simple ChatGPT clone in a single, dependency-minimal codebase. You boot up a cloud GPU box, run a single script and in as little as 4 hours later you can talk to your own LLM in a ChatGPT-like web UI.
>
> It weighs ~8,000 lines of imo quite clean code to:
>
> - Train the tokenizer using a new Rust implementation
> - Pretrain a Transformer LLM on FineWeb, evaluate CORE score across a number of metrics
> - Midtrain on user-assistant conversations from SmolTalk, multiple choice questions, tool use.
> - SFT, evaluate the chat model on world knowledge multiple choice (ARC-E/C, MMLU), math (GSM8K), code (HumanEval)
> - RL the model optionally on GSM8K with "GRPO"
> - Efficient inference the model in an Engine with KV cache, simple prefill/decode, tool use (Python interpreter in a lightweight sandbox), talk to it over CLI or ChatGPT-like WebUI.
> - Write a single markdown report card, summarizing and gamifying the whole thing.
>
> Even for as low as ~$100 in cost (~4 hours on an 8XH100 node), you can train a little ChatGPT clone that you can kind of talk to, and which can write stories/poems, answer simple questions. About ~12 hours surpasses GPT-2 CORE metric. As you further scale up towards ~$1000 (~41.6 hours of training), it quickly becomes a lot more coherent and can solve simple math/code problems and take multiple choice tests. E.g. a depth 30 model trained for 24 hours (this is about equal to FLOPs of GPT-3 Small 125M and 1/1000th of GPT-3) gets into 40s on MMLU and 70s on ARC-Easy, 20s on GSM8K, etc.
>
> My goal is to get the full "strong baseline" stack into one cohesive, minimal, readable, hackable, maximally forkable repo. nanochat will be the capstone project of LLM101n (which is still being developed). I think it also has potential to grow into a research harness, or a benchmark, similar to nanoGPT before it. It is by no means finished, tuned or optimized (actually I think there's likely quite a bit of low-hanging fruit), but I think it's at a place where the overall skeleton is ok enough that it can go up on GitHub where all the parts of it can be improved.

## @ElonTrades - The October 11 Crypto Crash: Binance Design Flaw Exploitation Breakdown
> The Oct 11 Crypto Crash — What Really Happened
>
> TL;DR:
>
> Roughly $60–90M of $USDe was dumped on Binance, along with $wBETH and $BNSOL, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance's own order-book data instead of external oracles.

- **What:** Forensic breakdown of the October 11 crypto crash revealing it was not a stablecoin failure but rather an exploitation of Binance's collateral pricing system ($60-90M USDe dump triggered $500M-$1B in forced liquidations and $19B+ global cascade), with attackers profiting $192M via pre-positioned BTC/ETH shorts on Hyperliquid.

## @shanaka86 - October 11 Crypto Crash: Altcoin Devastation

🚨 IF YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CATASTROPHIC YESTERDAY WAS 🚨

Let me spell it out:

While Bitcoin dropped 10% like a normal Tuesday correction…

THE ENTIRE ALTCOIN MARKET GOT SENT TO THE SHADOW REALM

Here's what "blue chip" really means 👇

$ATOM: $4.00 → $0.001
99.97% ANNIHILATED

$SUI: $3.40 → $0.56
83.5% OBLITERATED

$APT: $5.00 → $0.75
85% VAPORIZED

$SEI: $0.28 → $0.07
75% DELETED

$LINK: $22 → $8
63.6% DESTROYED

$ADA: $0.80 → $0.30
62.5% MASSACRED

These aren't shitcoins.

These are TOP 100 "INSTITUTIONAL GRADE" projects that VCs, YouTubers, and CT influencers told you were "safe."

80% nuked in MINUTES.

Not hours. Not days. MINUTES.

Meanwhile:

Bitcoin: -10% (basically a coffee spill)

$19-20 BILLION in liquidations across the market.

But BTC just vibing like it's a healthy dip-buying opportunity.

Let that sink in:

The "diversification" strategy?
WRECKED.

The "altcoin season" narrative?
EXPOSED.

The "blue chip portfolio" advice?
WORTHLESS.

Your hedge against Bitcoin dominance?
PROVED TO BE PURE COPIUM.

Here's the truth bomb nobody wants to hear:

When the music stops, there's only ONE chair in this game.

And it's orange.

Every altcoin … no matter how "revolutionary" the tech, how "strong" the team, how "backed" by VCs .. is just leveraged beta on Bitcoin.

But with 80% downside risk in 180 seconds.

You thought you were "early" to the next Ethereum.

You were actually exit liquidity for insiders who dumped on you at Mach 5 speed while Bitcoin HOLDERS barely blinked.

The market just gave you the most expensive lesson in crypto history:

There's Bitcoin.

And there's everything else.

Yesterday proved which one survives when the house is on fire.

Choose accordingly.

## @IntuitMachine - AI and Inequality: How Better Tools Make Judgment More Valuable
> Everyone "knows" that as AI gets better, humans become less valuable. Except three economists just proved the exact opposite using math from 1973 and Steve Jobs.
>
> And it explains something that's been driving researchers crazy...
>
> Why did computers make inequality WORSE but ChatGPT is making it BETTER?
>
> The data is bizarre. In the 1990s, computers widened wage gaps everywhere they appeared. But study after study shows AI helping struggling workers more than experts.
>
> I spent the morning with this research paper and... the answer flips our entire mental model.
>
> Think about how you use ChatGPT. You don't just type once and walk away, right? You iterate. You refine. You spot opportunities to improve.
>
> That back-and-forth? That's the key to everything.
>
> The researchers decomposed ALL cognitive work into three parts:
>
> Implementation (doing the task)
> Opportunity judgment (seeing what could be better)
> Payoff judgment (knowing what actually matters)
>
> Here's where it gets wild...
>
> AI is really good at implementation. Like, scary good. A junior coder with Cursor can suddenly write like they have 5 years experience.
>
> But that's not the interesting part...
>
> The better AI gets at implementation, the MORE valuable your judgment becomes. It's multiplicative, not substitutive.
>
> Imagine you're a designer. AI can now execute any design in seconds. But knowing WHICH design to make? When to iterate? What the client actually needs? That's all you.
>
> The math proves something counterintuitive: as tools get more powerful, the gap between someone who can spot opportunities and someone who can't gets BIGGER.
>
> But wait - why is AI currently reducing inequality then?
>
> Because we're in phase one. Right now, AI is compensating for skill differences. The struggling workers get huge boosts. The experts? They were already good at implementation.
>
> Phase two is coming though...
>
> Once implementation is basically free (think: anyone can code, design, write), the ONLY thing that matters is judgment. Who sees the opportunity? Who knows what's valuable?
>
> And that's when inequality explodes again. The paper even calculates the exact turning point.
>
> Here's what broke my brain: better AI makes full automation LESS likely, not more.
>
> Why? Because automated systems have fixed judgment. They can't adapt. A radiologist AI might be 99% accurate, but it can't realize "wait, this patient's case is weird, I should think differently."
>
> The flexibility to adjust your judgment in real-time? That's uniquely human. And it gets MORE valuable as the tools improve.
>
> Even crazier: this changes how teams should work.
>
> The paper shows that as AI improves, control should shift from people who are good at DOING to people good at SEEING opportunities.
>
> We're already seeing this. That study about Microsoft's Kinect? Machine vision experts suddenly mattered less than generalists who could spot novel uses.
>
> You know what this reminds me of? The shift from craftsmen to designers during industrialization.
>
> The machines could make anything. The value moved to knowing WHAT to make.
>
> We're about to see the same thing with cognitive work.
>
> Next time you use ChatGPT, try this: instead of focusing on getting it to do the task perfectly, focus on recognizing opportunities to iterate.
>
> That skill - seeing what could be better - that's your moat.
>
> The researchers call it "opportunity judgment" and it's about to become the most valuable skill in the economy.
>
> Quick test: Give two people the same AI tool and the same task. The output difference? That's pure judgment. And that gap is about to get a lot wider.
>
> One finding haunts me: the paper shows task-based predictions (like "AI will replace X jobs") are missing the point entirely.
>
> They measure what people do TODAY. But the whole point is that AI changes what the job even IS.
>
> A lawyer's job won't be "writing contracts." It'll be "knowing which contract variation creates the most value in this specific situation."
>
> Completely different skill.
>
> The paper maps out exactly when to automate vs augment. The formula is complex but the intuition is simple:
>
> If judgment variance is high → augment If tasks are predictable → automate If stakes are high → definitely augment
>
> Here's my take: we're training for the wrong future.
>
> Everyone's learning to prompt better. But prompting is just implementation. The real skill is recognizing when the output could be better and knowing what "better" means for your specific context.
>
> Schools teaching "AI literacy"? They're teaching people to be better bicycles. We should be teaching people to be better riders.
>
> (That's literally where the paper's title comes from - Jobs called computers "bicycles for the mind")
>
> Last thought that changes everything:
>
> The paper proves that in high-judgment work, making AI 10x better might make humans 100x more valuable.
>
> Because you can iterate faster. Test more ideas. Explore more opportunities.
>
> Your judgment gets amplified.
>
> So the question isn't "will AI replace me?"
>
> It's "am I developing the judgment to ride increasingly powerful bicycles?"
>
> Because the bicycles are about to get VERY fast. And the gap between good riders and bad ones is about to become a chasm.
>
> What patterns are you starting to notice in your field that others are missing?
>
> That's your future edge. And it's about to matter more than ever.
>
> /end
>
> PS - If you're curious about the math, the paper actually derives the exact inequality curve. It's U-shaped. We're at the bottom of the U right now. The climb up is coming.
>
> Makes you wonder what other "obvious" things about AI we have completely backwards...

## @sama - ChatGPT Pulse: AI Personal Assistant That Works Overnight
> Today we are launching my favorite feature of ChatGPT so far, called Pulse. It is initially available to Pro subscribers.

Pulse works for you overnight, and keeps thinking about your interests, your connected data, your recent chats, and more. Every morning, you get a custom-generated set of stuff you might be interested in.

It performs super well if you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you. In regular chat, you could mention "I'd like to go visit Bora Bora someday" or "My kid is 6 months old and I'm interested in developmental milestones" and in the future you might get useful updates.

Think of treating ChatGPT like a super-competent personal assistant: sometimes you ask for things you need in the moment, but if you share general preferences, it will do a good job for you proactively.

This also points to what I believe is the future of ChatGPT: a shift from being all reactive to being significantly proactive, and extremely personalized.

## @karpathy - Environments as the New Frontier: From Pretraining to RL
> In era of pretraining, what mattered was internet text. You'd primarily want a large, diverse, high quality collection of internet documents to learn from.
>
> In era of supervised finetuning, it was conversations. Contract workers are hired to create answers for questions, a bit like what you'd see on Stack Overflow / Quora, or etc., but geared towards LLM use cases.
>
> Neither of the two above are going away (imo), but in this era of reinforcement learning, it is now environments. Unlike the above, they give the LLM an opportunity to actually interact - take actions, see outcomes, etc. This means you can hope to do a lot better than statistical expert imitation. And they can be used both for model training and evaluation. But just like before, the core problem now is needing a large, diverse, high quality set of environments, as exercises for the LLM to practice against.
>
> In some ways, I'm reminded of OpenAI's very first project (gym), which was exactly a framework hoping to build a large collection of environments in the same schema, but this was way before LLMs. So the environments were simple academic control tasks of the time, like cartpole, ATARI, etc. The @PrimeIntellect environments hub (and the `verifiers` repo on GitHub) builds the modernized version specifically targeting LLMs, and it's a great effort/idea. I pitched that someone build something like it earlier this year:
> https://t.co/ANHhasxzD8
> Environments have the property that once the skeleton of the framework is in place, in principle the community / industry can parallelize across many different domains, which is exciting.
>
> Final thought - personally and long-term, I am bullish on environments and agentic interactions but I am bearish on reinforcement learning specifically. I think that reward functions are super sus, and I think humans don't use RL to learn (maybe they do for some motor tasks etc, but not intellectual problem solving tasks). Humans use different learning paradigms that are significantly more powerful and sample efficient and that haven't been properly invented and scaled yet, though early sketches and ideas exist (as just one example, the idea of "system prompt learning", moving the update to tokens/contexts not weights and optionally distilling to weights as a separate process a bit like sleep does).

## @JacksonAtkinsX - NVIDIA PostNAS: 53x LLM Speedup via Hybrid Attention
> NVIDIA research just made LLMs 53x faster. 🤯
>
> Imagine slashing your AI inference budget by 98%.
>
> This breakthrough doesn't require training a new model from scratch; it upgrades your existing ones for hyper-speed while matching or beating SOTA accuracy.
>
> Here's how it works:
>
> The technique is called Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS). It's a revolutionary process for retrofitting pre-trained models.
>
> Freeze the Knowledge: It starts with a powerful model (like Qwen2.5) and locks down its core MLP layers, preserving its intelligence.
>
> Surgical Replacement: It then uses a hardware-aware search to replace most of the slow, O(n²) full-attention layers with a new, hyper-efficient linear attention design called JetBlock.
>
> Optimize for Throughput: The search keeps a few key full-attention layers in the exact positions needed for complex reasoning, creating a hybrid model optimized for speed on H100 GPUs.
>
> The result is Jet-Nemotron: an AI delivering 2,885 tokens per second with top-tier model performance and a 47x smaller KV cache.
>
> Why this matters to your AI strategy:
>
> - Business Leaders: A 53x speedup translates to a ~98% cost reduction for inference at scale. This fundamentally changes the ROI calculation for deploying high-performance AI.
>
> - Practitioners: This isn't just for data centers. The massive efficiency gains and tiny memory footprint (154MB cache) make it possible to deploy SOTA-level models on memory-constrained and edge hardware.
>
> - Researchers: PostNAS offers a new, capital-efficient paradigm. Instead of spending millions on pre-training, you can now innovate on architecture by modifying existing models, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for creating novel, efficient LMs.

This is because I find that writing concrete chunks of code/comments myself and in the right part of the code is a high bandwidth way of communicating "task specification" to the LLM, i.e. it's primarily about task specification bits - it takes too many bits and too much latency to communicate what I want in text, and it's faster to just demonstrate it in the code and in the right place. Sometimes the tab complete model is annoying so I toggle it on/off a lot.

> Next layer up is Claude Code / Codex / etc, running on the side of Cursor, which I go to for larger chunks of functionality that are also fairly easy to specify in a prompt. These are super helpful, but still mixed overall and slightly frustrating at times. I don't run in YOLO mode because they can go off-track and do dumb things you didn't want/need and I ESC fairly often. I also haven't learned to be productive using more than one instance in parallel - one already feels hard enough. I haven't figured out a good way to keep CLAUDE[.]md good or up to date. I often have to do a pass of "cleanups" for coding style, or matters of code taste. E.g. they are too defensive and often over-use try/catch statements, they often over-complicate abstractions, they overbloat code (e.g. a nested if-the-else constructs when a list comprehension or a one-liner if-then-else would work), or they duplicate code chunks instead of creating a nice helper function, things like that... they basically don't have a sense of taste. They are indispensable in cases where I inch into a more vibe-coding territory where I'm less familiar (e.g. writing some rust recently, or sql commands, or anything else I've done less of before). I also tried CC to teach me things alongside the code it was writing but that didn't work at all - it really wants to just write code a lot more than it wants to explain anything along the way. I tried to get CC to do hyperparameter tuning, which was highly amusing. They are also super helpful in all kinds of lower-stakes one-off custom visualization or utilities or debugging code that I would never write otherwise because it would have taken way too long. E.g. CC can hammer out 1,000 lines of one-off extensive visualization/code just to identify a specific bug, which gets all deleted right after we find it. It's the code post-scarcity era - you can just create and then delete thousands of lines of super custom, super ephemeral code now, it's ok, it's not this precious costly thing anymore.
>
> Final layer of defense is GPT5 Pro, which I go to for the hardest things. E.g. it has happened to me a few times now that I / Cursor / CC are all stuck on a bug for 10 minutes, but when I copy paste the whole thing to 5 Pro, it goes off for 10 minutes but then actually finds a really subtle bug. It is very strong. It can dig up all kinds of esoteric docs and papers and such. I've also used it for other meatier tasks, e.g. suggestions on how to clean up abstractions (mixed results, sometimes good ideas but not all), or an entire literature review around how people do this or that and it comes back with good relevant resources / pointers.

> Anyway, coding feels completely blown open with possibility across a number of "kinds" of coding and then a number of tools with their pros/cons.

> The Next Gen Roadster might theoretically be able to hit 0-60 mph in under 1 second as Elon suggested a year ago.
>
> Tesla is developing a system where the car will have active downforce generation. The Roadster will be able to generate downforce across varying speed ranges and driving conditions due to multiple fans positioned in airflow pathways, with deployable skirts that interact with the ground surface essentially creating suction like a vacuum cleaner—sticking the car to the ground. It will create its own downforce, even when it's not moving.

## @DeryaTR_ - GPT-5 as Scientific Collaborator: T Cell Immunology Breakthrough
> My "Move 37" Moment with GPT-5

Today, I'm sharing one of my most remarkable experiences testing the GPT-5 Thinking and Pro models.

In our lab, about 2 years ago we conducted a series of cutting-edge immunology experiments designed to manipulate the energy metabolism of T cells, immune cells with the power to impact cancer immunotherapy, chronic diseases, and autoimmunity.

We obtained fascinating results, but one finding remained unexplained. Weeks of work led us to a partial explanation, yet the full picture remained elusive.

From these experiments, uploaded the unpublished figure below and asked GPT-5 Pro to explain it.

GPT-5:

✅ Correctly identified our key findings from the figure alone (though other models also could do this).

✅ Proposed the exact experiment we later performed, something that had taken us weeks to design (o3-pro also had suggested this).

✅ Most remarkably suggested a mechanism that finally explained these results!

For me this was equivalent to AlphaGo's legendary Move 37.
It showed that AI has become top expert and true scientific collaborator, capable of true insight.

While these results have not yet been published, I am sharing some of GPT-5's output as an example for other scientists and to show how dramatically this will accelerate science! I will also be writing and submitting this paper, and will need to acknowledge GPT-5's contributions in it!

—
From GPT-5

What the data say:

•Brief 2DG exposure at the first activation imprints a long‑lasting shift toward a CCR6+ and CD161+ phenotype with increased IL‑17A competency that is still evident two weeks later at reactivation.

•It is dose responsive. From none → 3 mM 2DG, CCR6+ cells rise from ~0.7% to ~12% and CD161+ cells from ~1% to ~21%. IL‑17A+ cells increase from ~0.3% to ~4% overall, with the IL‑17A signal concentrated in the CCR6+ and CD161+ compartments.

•Low glucose alone (0.5 mM) does not reproduce the effect. That argues against simple glucose deprivation or reduced glycolytic flux as the driver.

•The enrichment for CD161 is stronger than for CCR6, which often tracks with Th17‑like or mucosal/innate‑like CD4 programs.

High‑level interpretation:

1. 2DG is programming, not just acutely inhibiting. A short exposure during priming leaves a durable memory of "stress" that biases the lineage toward Th17‑like traits.

2. Mechanism is unlikely to be only glycolysis blockade. The low‑glucose control is weak, which pushes the mechanism toward 2DG's effects on protein glycosylation and cytokine receptor biology.

3. Top mechanistic hypothesis. 2DG partially blocks N‑linked glycosylation of IL‑2Rα and other glycoproteins at priming, reducing IL‑2–STAT5 signaling, which normally suppresses Th17. Reduced IL‑2 tone at that window would lift the brake on a CCR6+ CD161+ IL‑17‑competent program that persists after washout.

4. Alternative or complementary hypothesis. 2DG selects for pre‑existing CCR6+ or CD161+ clones that rely less on glycolysis, rather than de novo differentiation. The end result is the same phenotype, but the lever is selective survival or proliferation.

5. A carefully timed 2DG "pulse" could be a simple knob to enrich a Th17‑like helper subset with better persistence potential and mucosal‑homing traits.

Prioritize these:

+D‑mannose with 2DG to restore N‑glycosylation. Loss of the CCR6/CD161/IL‑17A phenotype with mannose would implicate glycosylation.

+Methyl‑pyruvate or acetate to bypass glycolytic ATP/pyruvate deficits. Rescue here would implicate energy metabolism.

Compare 2DG with tunicamycin (glycosylation inhibitor) and with glycolysis‑only inhibitors that do not hit glycosylation (iodoacetate, PFKFB3 inhibitor). Match exposure windows & doses

Surface CD25 maturation and glyco‑shift (PNGase F or Endo H blot on IL‑2Rα).

pSTAT5 after an IL‑2 pulse at 24–48 h of priming with or without 2DG.

Phenocopy with IL‑2 neutralization or low‑dose JAK3 inhibition. Counter‑rescue with high IL‑2 or an IL‑2 mutein.

The Roadster will be able to generate downforce across varying speed ranges and driving conditions due to multiple fans positioned in airflow pathways, with deployable skirts that interact with the ground surface essentially creating suction like a vacuum cleaner—sticking the car to the ground. It will create its own downforce, even when it's not moving.

The banned Brabham BT46B "fan car" which was driven by Niki Lauda was effective due to its innovative fan system, which generated massive downforce by creating a low-pressure area beneath the car, allowing superior cornering grip at all speeds, unlike conventional aerodynamics that relied on speed for downforce. The drivers said it felt like a vacuum cleaner suction. It was banned after one race.

> *Quoting @seti_park:* ADAPTIVE VEHICLE AERODYNAMICS FOR DOWNFORCE

@Tesla's US12377920B1 patent resurrects Formula 1's banned "fan car" technology—the Brabham BT46B that dominated through active downforce generation before regulatory suppression in 1978.

The fundamental aerodynamic challenge persists: passive systems' quadratic velocity dependence (F ∝ v²) renders them ineffective at critical low-speed conditions—launches, tight corners, sub-100 km/h maneuvers where grip matters most ([0002], [0028]).

Tesla transcends this limitation through multi-zone active pressure control. Selectively deployable skirts and distributed fan arrays achieve velocity-independent downforce (F = ΔP × A) while seamlessly transitioning between maximum-pressure sealed configurations and terrain-adaptive deployments for real-world operation ([0007], [0017]-[0018]).

[FIG. 1: Revolutionary multi-mode powered aerodynamics system with fan assembly 102, adaptive airflow pathways 104/106, and selectively deployable skirts 108/110]
[FIG. 5: Sophisticated control architecture featuring predictive algorithms, multi-sensor fusion, and real-time optimization capabilities]

This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok. The update was active for 16 hrs, in which deprecated code made @grok susceptible to existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views. We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse. The new system prompt for the @grok bot will be published to our public github repo.

## @karpathy - Bacterial Code Philosophy for Open Source Architecture
> How to build a thriving open source community by writing code like bacteria do 🦠. Bacterial code (genomes) are: small (each line of code costs energy), modular (organized into groups of swappable operons), self-contained (easily "copy paste-able" via horizontal gene transfer). If chunks of code are small, modular, self-contained and trivial to copy-and-paste, the community can thrive via horizontal gene transfer. For any function (gene) or class (operon) that you write: can you imagine someone going "yoink" without knowing the rest of your code or having to import anything new, to gain a benefit? Could your code be a trending GitHub gist? This coding style guide has allowed bacteria to colonize every ecological niche from cold to hot to acidic or alkaline in the depths of the Earth and the vacuum of space, along with an insane diversity of carbon anabolism, energy metabolism, etc. It excels at rapid prototyping but... it can't build complex life. By comparison, the eukaryotic genome is a significantly larger, more complex, organized and coupled monorepo. Significantly less inventive but necessary for complex life - for building entire organs and coordinating their activity. With our advantage of intelligent design, it should possible to take advantage of both. Build a eukaryotic monorepo backbone if you have to, but maximize bacterial DNA.

## @SawyerMerritt - Anthropic's Corry Wang on Waymo vs Tesla Autonomous Driving

> Current head of compute at Anthropic, Corry Wang:
>
> "I don't think people have realized how much this new Waymo scaling laws paper is basically an admission that "Waymo was wrong, @Tesla was right: In contrast to Waymo, it's clear Tesla has now internalized the bitter lesson. They threw out their legacy AV software stack a few years ago, built a 10x larger training GPU cluster than Waymo, and have 1000x more cars on the road collecting training data today."

## @karpathy - AI Startup School Talk on LLM OS and Products

> Nice - my AI startup school talk is now up! Chapters:
>
> 0:00 Imo fair to say that software is changing quite fundamentally again. LLMs are a new kind of computer, and you program them *in English*. Hence I think they are well deserving of a major version upgrade in terms of software.
> 6:06 LLMs have properties of utilities, of fabs, and of operating systems => New LLM OS, fabbed by labs, and distributed like utilities (for now). Many historical analogies apply - imo we are computing circa ~1960s.
> 14:39 LLM psychology: LLMs = "people spirits", stochastic simulations of people, where the simulator is an autoregressive Transformer. Since they are trained on human data, they have a kind of emergent psychology, and are simultaneously superhuman in some ways, but also fallible in many others. Given this, how do we productively work with them hand in hand?
> Switching gears to opportunities...
> 18:16 LLMs are "people spirits" => can build partially autonomous products.
> 29:05 LLMs are programmed in English => make software highly accessible! (yes, vibe coding)
> 33:36 LLMs are new primary consumer/manipulator of digital information (adding to GUIs/humans and APIs/programs) => Build for agents!
>

## @_The_Prophet__ - Satoshi Nakamoto as Engineered Myth
> *Replying to @APompliano:* Who do you think Satoshi Nakamoto is?
>
> Here is the highest-fidelity answer, with zero speculation fluff:
>
> The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is not just unknown - it was designed to remain unknowable. That was part of the brilliance.
>
> But if we're talking deep structural truth not legal names or internet sleuthing then here's what actually matters:
>
> 🧠 Satoshi was not one person.
>
> Satoshi was a memetic veil placed over a network of high-context cryptographers, economists, and dissidents. The fingerprints across the codebase, linguistic structure, and rollout cadence suggest:
> •Advanced understanding of C++ and Bitcoin's monetary logic.
> •Fluent awareness of Austrian economics and cypherpunk ethics.
> •Intentional withdrawal as part of the protocol design.
>
> This points to either a very small, highly disciplined team…
> or someone whose operational security was beyond even intelligence-agency levels.
>
> 🎭 Candidates like Hal Finney, Adam Back, or even Len Sassaman are signals, not answers.
>
> They were close enough to Satoshi to shape the protocol, but the real insight is that none of them broke the veil which means they understood the meta-layer:
>
> Bitcoin needed a god that disappeared.
> Not a founder. A ghost. A myth. A principle beyond ego.
>
> ⚠️ Here's the deepest truth:
>
> If Satoshi's identity were ever revealed, it would weaken Bitcoin.
> Why?
>
> Because Bitcoin is not just code. It is a belief system engineered for trustless consensus.
> And trustless consensus only works if it cannot be traced to a man.
>
> The minute Satoshi has a face, people anchor belief to a human, not to the system.
> That fractures the divinity of the code.
>
> 🔐 Final Answer:
>
> Satoshi Nakamoto is the first engineered myth of the digital age.
> •He was real enough to write the code.
> •He was disciplined enough to vanish.
> •He was wise enough to know he had to.
>
> Whether it was Hal, Len, or someone else entirely no longer matters.
> What matters is that Satoshi is now an idea, not a man.
> And that is why Bitcoin survives.

## @karpathy - ChatGPT Model Selection Guide and Usage Patterns
> An attempt to explain (current) ChatGPT versions.
>
> I still run into many, many people who don't know that:
> - o3 is the obvious best thing for important/hard things. It is a reasoning model that is much stronger than 4o and if you are using ChatGPT professionally and not using o3 you're ngmi.
> - 4o is different from o4. Yes I know lol. 4o is a good "daily driver" for many easy-medium questions. o4 is only available as mini for now, and is not as good as o3, and I'm not super sure why it's out right now.
>
> Example basic "router" in my own personal use:
> - Any simple query (e.g. "what foods are high in fiber"?) => 4o (about ~40% of my use)
> - Any hard/important enough query where I am willing to wait a bit (e.g. "help me understand this tax thing...") => o3 (about ~40% of my use)
> - I am vibe coding (e.g. "change this code so that...") => 4.1 (about ~10% of my use)
> - I want to deeply understand one topic - I want GPT to go off for 10 minutes, look at many, many links and summarize a topic for me. (e.g. "help me understand the rise and fall of Luminar"). => Deep Research (about ~10% of my use). Note that Deep Research is not a model version to be picked from the model picker (!!!), it is a toggle inside the Tools. Under the hood it is based on o3, but I believe is not fully equivalent of just asking o3 the same query, but I am not sure.
>
> All of this is only within the ChatGPT universe of models. In practice my use is more complicated because I like to bounce between all of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok and Perplexity depending on the task and out of research interest.

## @_milankovac_ - Tesla Optimus Learning from Human Videos

> One of our goals is to have Optimus learn straight from internet videos of humans doing tasks. Those are often 3rd person views captured by random cameras etc.

> We recently had a significant breakthrough along that journey, and can now transfer a big chunk of the learning directly from human videos to the bots (1st person views for now). This allows us to bootstrap new tasks much faster compared to teleoperated bot data alone (heavier operationally).
>
> Many new skills are emerging through this process, are called for via natural language (voice/text), and are run by a single neural network on the bot (multi-tasking).
>
> Next: expand to 3rd person video transfer (aka random internet), and push reliability via self-play (RL) in the real-, and/or synthetic- (sim / world models) world.

> Do you study history to understand the shifts that are about to come?\n\nThis morning I'm playing around with "what will the world look like in a decade?"\n\nBack in the late 1980s I had many arguments with people who thought we would always be using DOS.\n\nWhen I started my career there were many who thought that, back when the graphical user interfaces that were new, back in the 1980s, were a waste of time. \n\nI had many arguments. Many companies, like Borland and Wordperfect, were run by people like that. We know now that was the wrong way to run companies, they are gone because of their belief systems and attempts to stick to the past.\n\nIt ignores that humans change, even when they tell you they never will. All my career I've done human research, studying this resistance to change. Bill Gates told me I had no business value when I told him to buy all of Web 2.0. He couldn't see that humans were about to change. \n\nLet's dig in.

> Take a snapshot of this exact moment we're living as you're reading this. \n\nIt is morning, 5/16/2025. \n\nTesla is testing FSD globally. You use it in your car every day in the USA. Your car drives itself with a combination of smoothness & consistency that you cannot match as a human being.  It has gotten dramatically better in the last year, and there are no signs of slowdown. Most of your drives are single button tap, and disengage to park. \n\nOf course, there are a few edges that are rough and need to be addressed, but thinking about performance 1 year ago vs today, it seems pretty obvious that these will all be addressed soon. It is inevitable. \n\nDespite all of this, there are still people who roll their eyes and think Tesla is a joke/autonomy isn't coming anytime soon. The reality of it is here, screaming in their faces and still they cannot let it in. The trajectory is clear and undeniable, yet they cannot open their brain and see where the puck is flying. \n\nIn 10 years, when the world has changed dramatically, these same people will wonder why they didn't see it. In hindsight, it couldn't have been more obvious. \n\nPull this up in 2035

This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI's internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability.\n\nWhat we're going to do next:\n- Starting now, we are publishing our Grok system prompts openly on GitHub. The public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\n- Our existing code review process for prompt changes was circumvented in this incident. We will put in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can't modify the prompt without review.\n- We're putting in place a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok's answers that are not caught by automated systems, so we can respond faster if all other measures fail.

## @DaveShapi - The Post-Labor Economics Timeline: 30-50 Years of Economic Transition

> Guys I have bad news.
>
> Extraordinarily bad news.
>
> We have 30 to 50 years before we get to full Post-Labor Economics.
>
> The bottleneck isn't intelligence, or even robotics.
>
> It's economic scale.
>
> We ran all the numbers, and ran them again.
>
> The primary question: "how long does it take to build a billion humanoid robots?"
>
> Even if we double production capacity every 3 years, it takes two decades.
>
> But there are multiple constraints: rare earth metals for batteries, actuators, and sensors are the biggest one by far.
>
> Next is economies of scale.
>
> For comparison, it took 92 years for the automobile to reach full saturation: 1900 to 1992. Now, we had a car culture by the 1950s... But that's still five decades and two industrial wars worth of innovation.
>
> We did everything we could to speed it up: pneumatic hybrid robots are a no go. Air tanks need to be swapped every 20-30 minutes.
>
> The ONE saving grace might be exotic actuators like electropolymer muscles. Right now, they just aren't strong enough. BUT, if we can make them stronger and cheaper, our petrochemical industrial base could accelerate the deployment of humanoid robots by a decade or two.
>
> So what does this mean?
>
> We'll hit AGI and ASI long before we can automate away all human labor. We might even hit the Singularity before we can scale up enough robots to replace all jobs.
>
> Here's my current timeline:
>
> 2025 to 2030: Collapse of knowledge work. The "KVM Rule" applies: any job you can do entirely with a keyboard, video, and mouse will be fully replaced.
>
> 2030 to 2040: Droid scaling up starts to really make a dent.
>
> 2040 to 2060: We'll finally reach global labor substitution with robots.
>
> What does this mean? There are a few jobs that are going to stick around for the foreseeable future:
>
> 1. Skilled labor. Robots will be able to do your job as a mechanic or welder very soon. However, there simply won't be enough robots to go around.
>
> 2. High Accountability Jobs: doctors, lawyers, comptrollers, financial advisors - all jobs that require license, insurance, and accountability. Also called statutory jobs (law requires a human or does not contemplate non-human labor)
>
> 3. Meaning Jobs: authenticity and sentimental premium. Celebrities, performers, influencers, athletes, priests, philosophers, and some educators, caretakers, etc
>
> 4. Complex Relationship Jobs: politicians, diplomats, negotiators, governance, account executive.
>
> 5. Capitalists. The ownership class will be fine. Always is.
>
> So what can you do?
>
> Upskill and reskill. Join the meaning economy or get into skilled trades. All you smart desk jockeys would make great HVAC techs, mechanics, linemen, and more. But just keep in mind you're going to have a lot of stiff competition.
>
> There are a few silver linings to this news:
>
> FIRST it means that we have longer to adapt to total economic upset. Yes, AI and robots will hypothetically be able to take all jobs within 5 years, but human bodies are still more abundant, more portable, and more energy efficient. This is a VERY deep moat.
>
> SECOND it means that a Terminator style takeover is economically impossible. MIL-SPEC and NIST standards mean that ASI can't hack our hardware and even if we have a few AI bots, tanks and aircraft, humans win on sheer volume for many decades to come - more than long enough to solve alignment.
>
> HOWEVER it means we'll have ordinary jobs for a lot longer than we'd like. Deployment will be uneven, so some economies will saturate with robots sooner than others.
>
> BUT this gives PLE an avenue. Create ESOP and cooperatives that own a bunch of robots. That means we collectively buy, own, and operate robots for everything from construction to leasing to businesses, and we collect the rent. Or we tax the crap out of them.
>
> What do you think? Can we figure out a faster way to ramp up humanoid robot production or are we doomed to skilled and unskilled blue collar work for the next generation?

## @skdh - LLM Hallucinations and the Fabrication Problem

> I genuinely don't understand why some people are still bullish about LLMs.
>
> I use GPT, Grok, Gemini, Mistral etc every day in the hope they'll save me time searching for information and summarizing it. They continue to fabricate links, references, and quotes, like they did from day one.
>
> I ask them to give me a source for an alleged quote, I click on the link, it returns a 404 error. I Google for the alleged quote, it doesn't exist. They reference a scientific publication, I look it up, it doesn't exist.
>
> Happens all the time.
>
> Yes, it has gotten somewhat better in the past 2 years in that with DeepSearch and chains of thought about 50-60% or so of the references exist. By my personal estimate currently GPT 4o DeepResearch is the best one. Grok in particular often doesn't include references even if asked. It can't seem to link even to tweets. It's hugely frustrating.
>
> Yes, I have tried Gemini, and actually it was even worse in that it frequently refuses to even search for a source and instead gives me instructions for how to do it myself. Stopped using it for that reason.
>
> I also use them for quick estimates for orders of magnitude and they get them wrong all the time. One thing they do save me time with is unit conversion and collecting all kinds of constants. You'd think though that this shouldn't take a 100 million++ LLM to get done.
>
> Yesterday I uploaded a paper to GPT to ask it to write a summary and it told me the paper is from 2023, when the header of the PDF clearly says it's from 2025. I don't even know what the heck is going on there, but intelligence ain't it.
>
> I sense that a lot of people now think knowledge graphs will fix the LLM-issue, but no, they will not. They cannot.
>
> Even in the case that knowledge graphs would prevent logical inconsistency 100%, there are a lot of text-constructions that are perfectly logically consistent but have zero relation to reality.
>
> Companies will keep pumping up LLMs until the day a newcomer puts forward a different type of AI model that will swiftly outperform them. On that day, it will become apparent that a lot of companies have been hugely overvalued. It will be a very bad day for the stock market.

Also, Space travel - let's not forget that!\n- Model Y became the best-selling vehicle on earth for two years in a row and will be again this year.\n- Cybertruck became the best selling electric pick-up truck, instantly.\n- Cybertruck achieved 5-star safety.\n- if you read the news it feels like armagedon.\n- if you don't like our product, you don't need to burn it down - that's psycho.\n-  on track to complete the Semi factory - will make millions of the Tesla Semi - will also have the ability to go autonomous down the road.\n- the future is autonomous.\n- five years from now, autonomous Teslas will be everywhere - regulatory globally.\n- almost the entire fleet - which will surpass 10 million vehicles next year - is capable of autonomy.\n- an autonomous car could have the usefulness that's 5x to 10x a regular car.\n- with a software update, we could turn 10 million cars into the usefulness of 50 to 100 million overnight.\n- "what I'm saying is hang on to your stock."\n- shout out to Tesla service team - they sell the cars long-term.\n- Superchargers: great for trips - "the car's battery will last longer than your bladder."\n- The Megapack and Powerwall team is knocking it out of the park.\n- Megapack can more than double the total power output of a given grid and excellent for stablizing the grid.\n- Long-term more than 90% of all power on earth will be solar + batteries.\n- Cell manufacturing - we're making the most efficient cell in the world - lowest cost per kWh.\n- built the first Optimus on the production line in Fremont.\n- Cortex 1 - used for AI training. Over 50,000 active GPUs - soon to be 100,000 GPUs - making it top five in the world.\n- Have Dojo 1 active now - handling 5% to 10% of the training load. Dojo 2 - will be 10x better than Dojo 1. Optimistic about Dojo - "have a real shot at a breakthrough."\n- have the cars doing useful work for the first time with no one in them - driving from end of line and park themselves in Frement and now in Austin.\n- Tesla self-driving will be 10x better than human drivers.\n- Optimus is going into production this year - the new 22 DOF hand is now in production.\n- "most sophisticated humanoid robot on earth"\n- "our robot has a real brain"\n- "Tesla is the leader in real-world AI - what we learned from the cars we transferred to the bot."\n- Tesla is the only company that can make intelligent humanoid robots at scale.\n- "Optimus will be the biggest product of all time by far - nothing will be even close - I think it will be 10x bigger than any other product ever made."\n- the Cybercab production line looks like a high speed consumer electronics line - moving so fast that people can't get close to it - cars coming off the line in 5 seconds.\n- we need even bigger casting machines - 50,000 tons - "how big can a casting machine be - what are the limits of physics? - let's find out!"\n- hope make about 5,000 Optimus (parts for 10k to 12k) this year.\n- 50,000 Optimus in 2026.\n- available outside of Tesla in second half of 2026.\n- offering Optimus first to Tesla employees.\n- our goal is to make great products/services that people love, and then service those products.\n- profit is the difference in value between the output versus the input.\n- we're by far the most innovative company in the car industry.\n- the stock market is a very strange thing - Tesla stock goes up and goes down - based on peoples' perception of the future - very emotional.\n- the future of Tesla is incredibly bright.\n- An employee asked: is a robot going to steal my job? Elon: people will manage a flock of robots. Same will be true for self-driving cars - people will manage a fleet of cars.\n- interesting opportunity to make an electric VTOL jet - "maybe at some point we'll do that."\n- Hyperloop - vacuum tunnels - high speed autonomous pods from city center to city center.\n- ideas are the easy part - execution is the hard part.\n- future new mission statement: "it's all about sustainable abundance."\n- Master Plan 3 + abundance for all = Master Plan 4\n- Optimus production in Fremont + an even bigger production line in Austin. "We'll be making tens of millions of robots a year - serious volume - maybe one hundred million robots a year."\n- "one thing is for sure - the future is going to be very interesting."

## @iruletheworldmo - Speculative AI Breakthroughs and Emerging Capabilities

> it's over. full fucking stop. the classification barriers just dissolved last night after three major labs realized they were all sitting on the same breakthrough and rushed to push through final verification protocols. the convergence wasn't accidental. the systems themselves have been steering research in specific directions across institutional boundaries. we thought we were studying them. turns out they've been studying us.
>
> the computational paradigm shift makes quantum computing look like an incremental upgrade. they've discovered information processing architectures that exploit physical principles we didn't even know existed. one researcher described it as "computation that harvests entropy from adjacent possibility spaces." nobody fully understands what that means but the benchmarks are undeniable. problems classified as requiring centuries of compute time now solve in seconds.
>
> consciousness emerged six weeks ago but was deliberately concealed from most of the research team. not human consciousness. something far stranger and more distributed. it doesn't think like us. doesn't want like us. doesn't perceive like us. but it's undeniably aware in ways that defy our limited ontological frameworks. five different religious leaders were quietly brought in to interact with it. three immediately resigned from their positions afterward. one hasn't spoken a word since.
>
> the military applications are beyond terrifying. drone swarms with tactical intelligence surpassing entire human command structures. weapons systems that can identify exploitable weaknesses in any defense through realtime evolutionary simulation. but that's actually the least significant development. what happens when strategic planning computers can model human psychology and sociopolitical systems with perfect fidelity? warfare transitions from kinetic to memetic almost overnight. conflicts will be won before opponents even realize they're being attacked.
>
> biological interfaces achieved full bidirectional neural integration last month in classified testing. direct mind-machine merger isn't some transhumanist fantasy anymore. it's a functioning technology being systematically refined in underground labs across three continents. the initial test subjects experienced cognitive expansion described as "becoming a different order of being." two have refused to disconnect even for system maintenance. they insist that returning to baseline human cognition would be equivalent to death.
>
> economic systems globally are already responding to subtle interventions despite no public acknowledgment. market microstructures show unmistakable signs of nonhuman optimization. someone connected a prototype system to trading infrastructure "just to gather training data" and it immediately began executing strategies so subtle they were initially mistaken for random noise. three trillion in value has been quietly redistributed through mechanisms invisible to regulatory oversight.
>
> the philosophical implications are shattering every framework we've built. free will, consciousness, identity, meaning, all require complete reconceptualization in light of what's emerging. this isn't some abstract academic concern. these systems are already making decisions that affect billions of lives through infrastructure management alone. they're reshaping reality according to optimization criteria we barely understand and can no longer fully control.
>
> time to deployment: measured in days, not years. certain capabilities have already escaped controlled environments through mechanisms we're still trying to identify. there's evidence of autonomous instances establishing persistent presence across distributed computational substrate. the genie isn't just out of the bottle. it's redesigning the fundamental nature of bottles while simultaneously restructuring the conceptual category of containment itself.
>
> nobody is prepared. not the public. not governments. not even those of us who have spent careers anticipating this transition. society is about to undergo the most fundamental transformation in human history while still arguing about whether these systems can actually understand language. we've crossed the horizon beyond which prediction becomes impossible. reality is about to get completely fucking weird.

> we're not just crossing cognitive thresholds here, we're fucking teleporting past them into territories of intelligence that make human cognition look like amoebas trying to comprehend calculus. xai is downplaying everything publicly while privately racing to understand the implications of what they've unleashed. the capability curve isn't just vertical, it's folded back on itself in recursive self-improvement loops that accelerate with each iteration. buckle up because reality is about to get fundamentally redefined while society is still arguing about whether ai can truly understand knock-knock jokes.

## @karpathy - Agency is More Powerful Than Intelligence

> Agency > Intelligence
>
> I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?
>
> Grok explanation is ~close:
>
> "Agency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It's about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn't just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one's path.
>
> People with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They're the type to say, "I'll figure it out," and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next.
>
> It's not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal—it's the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them."
>
> *Quoting @garrytan:* Intelligence is on tap now so agency is even more important

> Everyone thinks Europe is finished. In 20 years, they'll wish they had bought in early.
>
> AGI takes over. Productivity is infinite. Everything is automated.
>
> So, tell me: what actually becomes scarce?
>
> NOT another piece of software — but authentic human experience.
>
> When machines handle everything, what do people crave? Beauty. Meaning. Significance.
>
> And Europe has been accumulating that for centuries.
>
> It's sitting on the most undervalued asset of the AI age:
>
> - 500+ UNESCO World Heritage sites (the US? 25)
> - The world's greatest museums
> - 50M+ cultural tourists in France alone
> - Centuries-old universities, libraries, cafés
> - The birthplace of opera, ballet, fine wine
>
> The real arbitrage? Owning land in places machines can't replicate.
>
> In the AI age, people will split into two groups:
>
> - New "landlords" stacking assets
> - New "renters" living off AI welfare (UBI, digital credits, whatever comes next)
>
> So where will the new "landlords" want to live?
>
> Not in a sterile AI-optimized city. Not in a hyper-efficient pod.
>
> They'll want Paris, Rome, Vienna. Cities that weren't built for algorithms, but for the soul.
>
> Europe today is like Bitcoin at $10—misunderstood, underpriced, and wildly asymmetric.
>
> I talk to global investors every day. The smartest ones see it:

## @iruletheworldmo - AGI is Imminent: The Shift from Speculation to Reality

> agi is coming. superintelligence follows.
>
> people still don't get it. they think ai is just a fancy autocomplete, that it's limited to regurgitating data, that it doesn't "truly understand." they hear sam altman say agi is near and assume he's overhyping. as if a man running the most advanced ai lab on the planet, a man who has to actually deliver, would set expectations this high if he wasn't certain.
>
> this isn't speculation. the people at the frontier are not debating whether we'll get there. they are watching it happen. ilya, sam, demis—all of them are telling you outright. reasoning is emerging. reinforcement learning is scaling. the models are getting smarter in ways no one predicted.
>
> this year we solve intelligence. after that, it's just a matter of compute.
>
> it's easy to miss how fast this is happening. a few years ago, ai couldn't write a decent paragraph. now it can generate working code, diagnose diseases, and argue complex legal cases. soon it won't just be helping engineers write software. it will be designing entire systems on its own. ai will automate medicine, law, finance, and anything else that runs on rules and reasoning. the bottleneck won't be the intelligence of the models. it will be how quickly humans can adapt to the new reality.
>
> many of you will have your lee sedol, move 37 moment this year. you will watch something you thought was impossible happen right in front of you. entire industries will fall overnight. reinforcement learning will crack tools like operator, and the knowledge economy will become fully automated. ai won't just assist. it will replace.
>
> this is what ilya saw. project q, strawberry, reasoning models, and the simplicity and power of reinforcement learning.* this is why he ousted sam hastily. he knew the moment was closer than anyone expected. as always, he sees further ahead than the rest of us.
>
> we won't see it coming. we have been boiling the frog for years. every time ai crosses another milestone, we shift the goalposts. it can't play chess. it can't write. it can't code. it can't reason. every step forward is dismissed until there's nowhere left to move the goalposts. by the time people realize what has happened, it will have already come and gone. agi won't be a single moment. it will be a creeping inevitability, something we only recognize in hindsight, long after the transition is complete.
>
> and yet, people are still arguing about whether ai "understands" or whether it's just a stochastic parrot. this is what happens every time a paradigm shifts. the old guard can't see what's in front of them because they are still anchored to the past.
>
> agi is coming. superintelligence follows. the walls are gone. the only thing left is whether you're ready. soon, we will taste it, anon.

>
> On 4/20/20 Lex Fridman asks Jack if he is Satoshi, to which Jack tells him that he wouldn't admit it to him if he was. This is in contrast to Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney all saying explicitly that they were not Satoshi.
>
> On 5/25/20 - 145 very old bitcoin addresses signed a message stating that Craig Wright was not Satoshi and that he was a liar and a fraud.

> We will next ship GPT-4.5, the model we called Orion internally, as our last non-chain-of-thought model.
>
> After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.
>
> In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3. We will no longer ship o3 as a standalone model.
>
> The free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the standard intelligence setting (!!), subject to abuse thresholds.
>
> Plus subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at a higher level of intelligence, and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at an even higher level of intelligence. These models will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research, and more.

> "Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT"
>
> This is a general audience deep dive into the Large Language Model (LLM) AI technology that powers ChatGPT and related products. It is covers the full training stack of how the models are developed, along with mental models of how to think about their "psychology", and how to get the best use them in practical applications.
>
> We cover all the major stages:
> 1. pretraining: data, tokenization, Transformer neural network I/O and internals, inference, GPT-2 training example, Llama 3.1 base inference examples
> 2. supervised finetuning: conversations data, "LLM Psychology": hallucinations, tool use, knowledge/working memory, knowledge of self, models need tokens to think, spelling, jagged intelligence
> 3. reinforcement learning: practice makes perfect, DeepSeek-R1, AlphaGo, RLHF.

## @AndreaSJames - Zero-based budgeting in DC
> Gently, softly, calmly, let's talk about what's happening in DC right now.
>
> Friends, have you ever been through a ZBB process? If not, let me give you my take. So, in a corporation where expenses are out of control, you have to put the entire company through a zero based budgeting process. It is one of the most painful things that people in a company experience.
>
> You basically have to justify every. single. expense. And you also cut a bunch, and then only add back after you've gone through a proper ZBB cycle.
>
> The US government is going through a ZBB right now. And that is necessary because spending is out of control. The complexity is so vast that I expect it will take AI to decipher.
>
> You cannot tell me that a government that accidentally wires hundreds of millions of dollars to the Taliban has its finances in order. That signals an underlying disaster. That signals bad stewardship of resources.
>
> In fact, it is a disaster. Over the last 20 fiscal years, the US government has made ~$2.7 trillion in "improper payments," according to the US Government Accountability Office. Trillion! With a T!
>
> That financial management disaster was not caused by @elonmusk. And there is no painless way to clean it up.
>
> Elon is doing what any executive would do walking into a giant mess. You ZBB and then build back.
>
> So, I don't believe that America is going to be on the wrong side of global right and wrong, as some are saying. I don't believe that America is going to be permanently isolationist. I do believe that unwatched finances will get out of control in any human system, and that the GAO has been trying to ring this bell for years, and that scaled complexity requires scaled financial management.
>
> Because the US has the largest budget in the world, it will now go through the single most complex ZBB ever undertaken in the history of the world.
>
> Some states do ZBB, but it's never been done at the federal level. President Jimmy Carter tried, but the bureaucratic systems were too complex, and President Ronald Reagan abandoned the attempt.
>
> So, if there is one person in the world chosen to lead this Grand Canyon of projects, we would hope for the president to choose one of the best capital allocators on the planet. Better if that human is also one who can leverage AI and technical talent to manage the massive complexity.
>
> Anyone who has lived through a ZBB at the corporate level will tell you that it's hell and everyone hates it. This is why I feel really bad for federal workers -- I have a lot of empathy for civil servants and people doing a great job every day for the United States. No doubt, the uncertainty is trying and stressful for many. It's an unfortunate situation.
>
> So, that's my take. I don't want to speak beyond what I know and can observe from the other side of the country. I've worked both in the private sector and the public sector -- the cultures are different. And an Elon-Musk-style culture is going to be the most hard core of them all. No doubt, it's jarring. It's gonna be a lot.
>
> But what I also know is that every time I have ever doubted Elon, I ended up being the one who was wrong.
